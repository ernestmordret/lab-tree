Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays	1999.0	['Uri Alon', 'Naama Barkai', 'Daniel A Notterman', 'Kurt Gish', 'Suzanne Ybarra', 'Daniel Mack', 'Arnold J Levine']	Proceedings of the national academy of sciences	Oligonucleotide arrays can provide a broad picture of the state of the cell, by monitoring the expression level of thousands of genes at the same time. It is of interest to develop techniques for extracting useful information from the resulting data sets. Here we report the application of a two-way clustering method for analyzing a data set consisting of the expression patterns of different cell types. Gene expression in 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissue samples was analyzed with an Affymetrix oligonucleotide array complementary to more than 6,500 human genes. An efficient two-way clustering algorithm was applied to both the genes and the tissues, revealing broad coherent patterns that suggest a high degree of organization underlying gene expression in these tissues. Coregulated families of genes clustered together, as demonstrated for the ribosomal proteins. Clustering also separated cancerous from …	https://www.pnas.org/content/96/12/6745.short	5314
Robustness in simple biochemical networks	1997.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Stan Leibler']	Nature	Cells use complex networks of interacting molecular components to transfer and process information. These “computational devices of living cells” 1 are responsible for many important cellular processes, including cell-cycle regulation and signal transduction. Here we address the issue of the sensitivity of the networks to variations in their biochemical parameters. We propose a mechanism for robust adaptation in simple signal transduction networks. We show that this mechanism applies in particular to bacterial chemotaxis 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This is demonstrated within a quantitative model which explains, in a unified way, many aspects of chemotaxis, including proper responses to chemical gradients 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The adaptation property 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 is a consequence of the network's connectivity and does not require the ‘fine-tuning’of parameters. We argue that the key properties of biochemical networks …	https://www.nature.com/articles/43199	1806
Robustness in bacterial chemotaxis	1999.0	['Uri Alon', 'Michael G Surette', 'Naama Barkai', 'Stanislas Leibler']	Nature	Networks of interacting proteins orchestrate the responses of living cells to a variety of external stimuli 1, but how sensitive is the functioning of these protein networks to variations in theirbiochemical parameters? One possibility is that to achieve appropriate function, the reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations need to be adjusted in a precise manner, and any deviation from these ‘fine-tuned’values ruins the network's performance. An alternative possibility is that key properties of biochemical networks are robust 2; that is, they are insensitive to the precise values of the biochemical parameters. Here we address this issue in experiments using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, one of the best-characterized sensory systems 3, 4. We focus on how response and adaptation to attractant signals vary with systematic changes in the intracellular concentration of the components of the chemotaxis network. We find …	https://www.nature.com/articles/16483	1421
Revealing modular organization in the yeast transcriptional network	2002.0	['Jan Ihmels', 'Gilgi Friedlander', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Ofer Sarig', 'Yaniv Ziv', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature genetics	Standard clustering methods can classify genes successfully when applied to relatively small data sets, but have limited use in the analysis of large-scale expression data, mainly owing to their assignment of a gene to a single cluster. Here we propose an alternative method for the global analysis of genome-wide expression data. Our approach assigns genes to context-dependent and potentially overlapping'transcription modules', thus overcoming the main limitations of traditional clustering methods. We use our method to elucidate regulatory properties of cellular pathways and to characterize cis-regulatory elements. By applying our algorithm systematically to all of the available expression data on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identify a comprehensive set of overlapping transcriptional modules. Our results provide functional predictions for numerous genes, identify relations between modules and present a …	https://www.nature.com/articles/ng941z	900
Noise in protein expression scales with natural protein abundance	2006.0	"['Arren Bar-even', 'Johan Paulsson', 'Narendra Maheshri', 'Miri Carmi', ""Erin O'shea"", 'Yitzhak Pilpel', 'Naama Barkai']"	Nature genetics	Noise in gene expression is generated at multiple levels, such as transcription and translation, chromatin remodeling and pathway-specific regulation. Studies of individual promoters have suggested different dominating noise sources, raising the question of whether a general trend exists across a large number of genes and conditions. We examined the variation in the expression levels of 43 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, in cells grown under 11 experimental conditions. For all classes of genes and under all conditions, the expression variance was approximately proportional to the mean; the same scaling was observed at steady state and during the transient responses to the perturbations. Theoretical analysis suggests that this scaling behavior reflects variability in mRNA copy number, resulting from random'birth and death'of mRNA molecules or from promoter fluctuations. Deviation of coexpressed genes …	https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1807	890
Mechanisms of noise-resistance in genetic oscillators	2002.0	['José Mg Vilar', 'Hao Yuan Kueh', 'Naama Barkai', 'Stanislas Leibler']	Proceedings of the national academy of sciences	A wide range of organisms use circadian clocks to keep internal sense of daily time and regulate their behavior accordingly. Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements. The integration of these “circuits” at the cellular level imposes strong constraints on their functioning and design. Here, we study a recently proposed model [Barkai, N. & Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London), 403, 267–268] that incorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA …	https://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/5988.short	726
Circadian clocks limited by noise	2000.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Stanislas Leibler']	Nature	Circadian rhythms, which provide internal daily periodicity, are used by a wide range of organisms to anticipate daily changes in the environment 1. It seems that these organisms generate circadian periodicity by similar biochemical networks within a single cell 2. A model based on the common features of these biochemical networks shows that a circadian network can oscillate reliably in the presence of stochastic biochemical noise and when cellular conditions are altered. We propose that the ability to resist such perturbations imposes strict constraints on the oscillation mechanisms underlying circadian periodicity in vivo.	https://www.nature.com/articles/35002258	689
Iterative signature algorithm for the analysis of large-scale gene expression data	2003.0	['Sven Bergmann', 'Jan Ihmels', 'Naama Barkai']	Physical review e	We present an approach for the analysis of genome-wide expression data. Our method is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional techniques, when applied to large-scale data. Rather than alloting each gene to a single cluster, we assign both genes and conditions to context-dependent and potentially overlapping transcription modules. We provide a rigorous definition of a transcription module as the object to be retrieved from the expression data. An efficient algorithm, which searches for the modules encoded in the data by iteratively refining sets of genes and conditions until they match this definition, is established. Each iteration involves a linear map, induced by the normalized expression matrix, followed by the application of a threshold function. We argue that our method is in fact a generalization of singular value decomposition, which corresponds to the special case where no threshold is applied …	https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.67.031902	566
Robustness of the BMP morphogen gradient in Drosophila embryonic patterning	2002.0	['Avigdor Eldar', 'Ruslan Dorfman', 'Daniel Weiss', 'Hilary Ashe', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature	Developmental patterning relies on morphogen gradients, which generally involve feedback loops to buffer against perturbations caused by fluctuations in gene dosage and expression 1. Although many gene components involved in such feedback loops have been identified, how they work together to generate a robust pattern remains unclear. Here we study the network of extracellular proteins that patterns the dorsal region of the Drosophila embryo by establishing a graded activation of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway. We find that the BMP activation gradient itself is robust to changes in gene dosage. Computational search for networks that support robustness shows that transport of the BMP class ligands (Scw and Dpp) into the dorsal midline by the BMP inhibitor Sog is the key event in this patterning process. The mechanism underlying robustness relies on the ability to store an excess of …	https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01061	511
Similarities and differences in genome-wide expression data of six organisms	2004.0	['Sven Bergmann', 'Jan Ihmels', 'Naama Barkai', 'Michael Eisen']	Plos biology	Comparing genomic properties of different organisms is of fundamental importance in the study of biological and evolutionary principles. Although differences among organisms are often attributed to differential gene expression, genome-wide comparative analysis thus far has been based primarily on genomic sequence information. We present a comparative study of large datasets of expression profiles from six evolutionarily distant organisms: S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, E. coli, A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens. We use genomic sequence information to connect these data and compare global and modular properties of the transcription programs. Linking genes whose expression profiles are similar, we find that for all organisms the connectivity distribution follows a power-law, highly connected genes tend to be essential and conserved, and the expression program is highly modular. We reveal the modular structure by decomposing each set of expression data into coexpressed modules. Functionally related sets of genes are frequently coexpressed in multiple organisms. Yet their relative importance to the transcription program and their regulatory relationships vary among organisms. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining sequence and expression data for improving functional gene annotation and expanding our understanding of how gene expression and diversity evolved.	https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020009	456
Defining transcription modules using large-scale gene expression data	2004.0	['Jan Ihmels', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Naama Barkai']	Bioinformatics	 Motivation: Large-scale gene expression data comprising a variety of cellular conditions hold the promise of a global view on the transcription program. While conventional clustering algorithms have been successfully applied to smaller datasets, the utility of many algorithms for the analysis of large-scale data is limited by their inability to capture combinatorial and condition-specific co-regulation. In addition, there is an increasing need to integrate the rapidly accumulating body of other high-throughput biological data with the expression analysis. In a previous work, we introduced the signature algorithm, which overcomes the problems of conventional clustering and allows for intuitive integration of additional biological data. However, this approach is constrained by the comprehensiveness of relevant external data and its lacking ability to capture hierarchical modularity. Methods: We present a …	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/20/13/1993/241660	439
Two strategies for gene regulation by promoter nucleosomes	2008.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome research	Chromatin structure is central for the regulation of gene expression, but its genome-wide organization is only beginning to be understood. Here, we examine the connection between patterns of nucleosome occupancy and the capacity to modulate gene expression upon changing conditions, i.e., transcriptional plasticity. By analyzing genome-wide data of nucleosome positioning in yeast, we find that the presence of nucleosomes close to the transcription start site is associated with high transcriptional plasticity, while nucleosomes at more distant upstream positions are negatively correlated with transcriptional plasticity. Based on this, we identify two typical promoter structures associated with low or high plasticity, respectively. The first class is characterized by a relatively large nucleosome-free region close to the start site coupled with well-positioned nucleosomes further upstream, whereas the second class displays …	https://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/7/1084.short	426
A yeast hybrid provides insight into the evolution of gene expression regulation	2009.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Sharon Reikhav', 'Avraham A Levy', 'Naama Barkai']	Science	During evolution, novel phenotypes emerge through changes in gene expression, but the genetic basis is poorly understood. We compared the allele-specific expression of two yeast species and their hybrid, which allowed us to distinguish changes in regulatory sequences of the gene itself (cis) from changes in upstream regulatory factors (trans). Expression divergence between species was generally due to changes in cis. Divergence in trans reflected a differential response to the environment and explained the tendency of certain genes to diverge rapidly. Hybrid-specific expression, deviating from the parental range, occurred through novel cis-trans interactions or, more often, through modified trans regulation associated with environmental sensing. These results provide insights on the regulatory changes in cis and trans during the divergence of species and upon hybridization.	https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1169766	387
Rewiring of the yeast transcriptional network through the evolution of motif usage	2005.0	['Jan Ihmels', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Maryam Gerami-nejad', 'Itai Yanai', 'Mark Mcclellan', 'Judith Berman', 'Naama Barkai']	Science	Recent experiments revealed large-scale differences in the transcription programs of related species, yet little is known about the genetic basis underlying the evolution of gene expression and its contribution to phenotypic diversity. Here we describe a large-scale modulation of the yeast transcription program that is connected to the emergence of the capacity for rapid anaerobic growth. Genes coding for mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins display a strongly correlated expression pattern in Candida albicans, but this correlation is lost in the fermentative yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We provide evidence that this change in gene expression is connected to the loss of a specific cis-regulatory element from dozens of genes following the apparent whole-genome duplication event. Our results shed new light on the genetic mechanisms underlying the large-scale evolution of transcriptional networks.	https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1113833	341
Principles of transcriptional control in the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae	2004.0	['Jan Ihmels', 'Ronen Levy', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature biotechnology	Cellular networks are subject to extensive regulation, which modifies the availability and efficiency of connections between components in response to external conditions. Thus far, studies of large-scale networks have focused on their connectivity, but have not considered how the modulation of this connectivity might also determine network properties. To address this issue, we analyzed how the coordinated expression of enzymes shapes the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By integrating large-scale expression data with the structural description of the metabolic network, we systematically characterized the transcriptional regulation of metabolic pathways. The analysis revealed recurrent patterns, which may represent design principles of metabolic gene regulation. First, we find that transcription regulation biases metabolic flow toward linearity by coexpressing only distinct branches at metabolic …	https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt918	319
Self-enhanced ligand degradation underlies robustness of morphogen gradients	2003.0	['Avigdor Eldar', 'Dalia Rosin', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']	Developmental cell	Morphogen gradients provide long-range positional information by extending across a developing field. To ensure reproducible patterning, their profile is invariable despite genetic or environmental fluctuations. Common models assume a morphogen profile that decays exponentially. Here, we show that exponential profiles cannot, at the same time, buffer fluctuations in morphogen production rate and define long-range gradients. To comply with both requirements, morphogens should decay rapidly close to their source but at a significantly slower rate over most of the field. Numerical search revealed two network designs that support robustness to fluctuations in morphogen production rate. In both cases, morphogens enhance their own degradation, leading to a higher degradation rate close to their source. This is achieved through reciprocal interactions between the morphogen and its receptor. The two robust …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580703002922	313
A genetic signature of interspecies variations in gene expression	2006.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Adina Weinberger', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature genetics	Phenotypic diversity is generated through changes in gene structure or gene regulation. The availability of full genomic sequences allows for the analysis of gene sequence evolution. In contrast, little is known about the principles driving the evolution of gene expression. Here we describe the differential transcriptional response of four closely related yeast species to a variety of environmental stresses. Genes containing a TATA box in their promoters show an increased interspecies variability in expression, independent of their functional association. Examining additional data sets, we find that this enhanced expression divergence of TATA-containing genes is consistent across all eukaryotes studied to date, including nematodes, fruit flies, plants and mammals. TATA-dependent regulation may enhance the sensitivity of gene expression to genetic perturbations, thus facilitating expression divergence at particular …	https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1819	290
The cost of protein production	2016.0	['Moshe Kafri', 'Eyal Metzl-raz', 'Ghil Jona', 'Naama Barkai']	Cell reports	The economy of protein production is central to cell physiology, being intimately linked with cell division rate and cell size. Attempts to model cellular physiology are limited by the scarcity of experimental data defining the molecular processes limiting protein expression. Here, we distinguish the relative contribution of gene transcription and protein translation to the slower proliferation of budding yeast producing excess levels of unneeded proteins. In contrast to widely held assumptions, rapidly growing cells are not universally limited by ribosome content. Rather, transcription dominates cost under some conditions (e.g., low phosphate), translation in others (e.g., low nitrogen), and both in other conditions (e.g., rich media). Furthermore, cells adapted to enforced protein production by becoming larger and increasing their endogenous protein levels, suggesting limited competition for common resources. We propose …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112471501428X	280
Scaling of the BMP activation gradient in Xenopus embryos	2008.0	['Danny Ben-zvi', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Abraham Fainsod', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature	In groundbreaking experiments, Hans Spemann demonstrated that the dorsal part of the amphibian embryo can generate a well-proportioned tadpole, and that a small group of dorsal cells, the ‘organizer’, can induce a complete and well-proportioned twinned axis when transplanted into a host embryo. Key to organizer function is the localized secretion of inhibitors of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), which defines a graded BMP activation profile. Although the central proteins involved in shaping this gradient are well characterized, their integrated function, and in particular how pattern scales with size, is not understood. Here we present evidence that in Xenopus, the BMP activity gradient is defined by a ‘shuttling-based’mechanism, whereby the BMP ligands are translocated ventrally through their association with the BMP inhibitor Chordin. This shuttling, with feedback repression of the BMP ligand Admp, offers a …	https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07059/boxes/bx1	245
Pre-steady-state decoding of the Bicoid morphogen gradient	2007.0	['Sven Bergmann', 'Oded Sandler', 'Hila Sberro', 'Sara Shnider', 'Eyal Schejter', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos biology	Morphogen gradients are established by the localized production and subsequent diffusion of signaling molecules. It is generally assumed that cell fates are induced only after morphogen profiles have reached their steady state. Yet, patterning processes during early development occur rapidly, and tissue patterning may precede the convergence of the gradient to its steady state. Here we consider the implications of pre-steady-state decoding of the Bicoid morphogen gradient for patterning of the anterior–posterior axis of the Drosophila embryo. Quantitative analysis of the shift in the expression domains of several Bicoid targets (gap genes) upon alteration of bcd dosage, as well as a temporal analysis of a reporter for Bicoid activity, suggest that a transient decoding mechanism is employed in this setting. We show that decoding the pre-steady-state morphogen profile can reduce patterning errors caused by fluctuations in the rate of morphogen production. This can explain the surprisingly small shifts in gap and pair-rule gene expression domains observed in response to alterations in bcd dosage.	https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050046	214
Noise propagation and signaling sensitivity in biological networks: a role for positive feedback	2008.0	['Gil Hornung', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos computational biology	Interactions between genes and proteins are crucial for efficient processing of internal or external signals, but this connectivity also amplifies stochastic fluctuations by propagating noise between components. Linear (unbranched) cascades were shown to exhibit an interplay between the sensitivity to changes in input signals and the ability to buffer noise. We searched for biological circuits that can maintain signaling sensitivity while minimizing noise propagation, focusing on cases where the noise is characterized by rapid fluctuations. Negative feedback can buffer this type of noise, but this buffering comes at the expense of an even greater reduction in signaling sensitivity. By systematically analyzing three-component circuits, we identify positive feedback as a central motif allowing for the buffering of propagated noise while maintaining sensitivity to long-term changes in input signals. We show analytically that noise reduction in the presence of positive feedback results from improved averaging of rapid fluctuations over time, and discuss in detail a particular implementation in the control of nutrient homeostasis in yeast. As the design of biological networks optimizes for multiple constraints, positive feedback can be used to improve sensitivity without a compromise in the ability to buffer propagated noise.	https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040008	208
Comparative Gene Expression Analysis by a Differential Clustering Approach: Application to the Candida albicans Transcription Program	2005.0	['Jan Ihmels', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Judith Berman', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos genetics	Differences in gene expression underlie many of the phenotypic variations between related organisms, yet approaches to characterize such differences on a genome-wide scale are not well developed. Here, we introduce the “differential clustering algorithm” for revealing conserved and diverged co-expression patterns. Our approach is applied at different levels of organization, ranging from pair-wise correlations within specific groups of functionally linked genes, to higher-order correlations between such groups. Using the differential clustering algorithm, we systematically compared the transcription program of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans with that of the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Many of the identified differences are related to the differential requirement for mitochondrial function in the two yeasts. Distinct regulation patterns of cell cycle genes and of amino acid metabolic genes were also revealed and, in some cases, could be linked to the differential appearance of cis-regulatory elements in the gene promoter regions. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for comparative gene expression analysis and a rich source of hypotheses for uncharacterized open reading frames and putative cis-regulatory elements in C. albicans.	https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010039	163
Scaling of morphogen gradients by an expansion-repression integral feedback control	2010.0	['Danny Ben-zvi', 'Naama Barkai']	Proceedings of the national academy of sciences	Despite substantial size variations, proportions of the developing body plan are maintained with a remarkable precision. Little is known about the mechanisms that ensure this adaptation (scaling) of pattern with size. Most models of patterning by morphogen gradients do not support scaling. In contrast, we show that scaling arises naturally in a general feedback topology, in which the range of the morphogen gradient increases with the abundance of some diffusible molecule, whose production, in turn, is repressed by morphogen signaling. We term this mechanism “expansion–repression” and show that it can function within a wide range of biological scenarios. The expansion-repression scaling mechanism is analogous to an integral-feedback controller, a key concept in engineering that is likely to be instrumental also in maintaining biological homeostasis.	https://www.pnas.org/content/107/15/6924.short	162
A biological solution to a fundamental distributed computing problem	2011.0	['Yehuda Afek', 'Noga Alon', 'Omer Barad', 'Eran Hornstein', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ziv Bar-joseph']	Science	Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly’s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.	https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1193210	159
Noise–mean relationship in mutated promoters	2012.0	['Gil Hornung', 'Raz Bar-ziv', 'Dalia Rosin', 'Nobuhiko Tokuriki', 'Dan S Tawfik', 'Moshe Oren', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome research	Gene expression depends on the frequency of transcription events (burst frequency) and on the number of mRNA molecules made per event (burst size). Both processes are encoded in promoter sequence, yet their dependence on mutations is poorly understood. Theory suggests that burst size and frequency can be distinguished by monitoring the stochastic variation (noise) in gene expression: Increasing burst size will increase mean expression without changing noise, while increasing burst frequency will increase mean expression and decrease noise. To reveal principles by which promoter sequence regulates burst size and frequency, we randomly mutated 22 yeast promoters chosen to span a range of expression and noise levels, generating libraries of hundreds of sequence variants. In each library, mean expression (m) and noise (coefficient of variation, η) varied together, defining a scaling curve: η2 = b/m …	https://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/12/2409.short	155
The evolving doublecortin (DCX) superfamily	2006.0	['Orly Reiner', 'Frédéric M Coquelle', 'Bastian Peter', 'Talia Levy', 'Anna Kaplan', 'Tamar Sapir', 'Irit Orr', 'Naama Barkai', 'Gregor Eichele', 'Sven Bergmann']	Bmc genomics	Doublecortin (DCX) domains serve as protein-interaction platforms. Mutations in members of this protein superfamily are linked to several genetic diseases. Mutations in the human DCX gene result in abnormal neuronal migration, epilepsy, and mental retardation; mutations in RP1 are associated with a form of inherited blindness, and DCDC2 has been associated with dyslectic reading disabilities. The DCX-repeat gene family is composed of eleven paralogs in human and in mouse. Its evolution was followed across vertebrates, invertebrates, and was traced to unicellular organisms, thus enabling following evolutionary additions and losses of genes or domains. The N-terminal and C-terminal DCX domains have undergone sub-specialization and divergence. Developmental in situ hybridization data for nine genes was generated. In addition, a novel co-expression analysis for most human and mouse DCX …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-7-188	131
Expansion-repression mechanism for scaling the Dpp activation gradient in Drosophila wing imaginal discs	2011.0	['Danny Ben-zvi', 'George Pyrowolakis', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']	Current biology	Maintaining a proportionate body plan requires the adjustment or scaling of organ pattern with organ size. Scaling is a general property of developmental systems, yet little is known about its underlying molecular mechanisms. Using theoretical modeling, we examine how the Dpp activation gradient in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc scales with disc size. We predict that scaling is achieved through an expansion-repression mechanism [1] whose mediator is the widely diffusible protein Pentagone (Pent). Central to this mechanism is the repression of pent expression by Dpp signaling, which provides an effective size measurement, and the Pent-dependent expansion of the Dpp gradient, which adjusts the gradient with tissue size. We validate this mechanism experimentally by demonstrating that scaling requires Pent and further, that scaling is abolished when pent is ubiquitously expressed. The expansion …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211007846	121
Promoter architecture and the evolvability of gene expression	2009.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Naama Barkai', 'Kevin J Verstrepen']		Evolutionary changes in gene expression are a main driver of phenotypic evolution. In yeast, genes that have rapidly diverged in expression are associated with particular promoter features, including the presence of a TATA box, a nucleosome-covered promoter and unstable tracts of tandem repeats. Here, we discuss how these promoter properties may confer an inherent capacity for flexibility of expression.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/jbiol204	113
Principles of cellular resource allocation revealed by condition-dependent proteome profiling	2017.0	['Eyal Metzl-raz', 'Moshe Kafri', 'Gilad Yaakov', 'Ilya Soifer', 'Yonat Gurvich', 'Naama Barkai']	Elife	Growing cells coordinate protein translation with metabolic rates. Central to this coordination is ribosome production. Ribosomes drive cell growth, but translation of ribosomal proteins competes with production of non-ribosomal proteins. Theory shows that cell growth is maximized when all expressed ribosomes are constantly translating. To examine whether budding yeast function at this limit of full ribosomal usage, we profiled the proteomes of cells growing in different environments. We find that cells produce excess ribosomal proteins, amounting to a constant ≈8% of the proteome. Accordingly, ≈25% of ribosomal proteins expressed in rapidly growing cells does not contribute to translation. Further, this fraction increases as growth rate decreases and these excess ribosomal proteins are employed when translation demands unexpectedly increase. We suggest that steadily growing cells prepare for conditions that demand increased translation by producing excess ribosomes, at the expense of lower steady-state growth rate.	https://elifesciences.org/articles/28034	112
Variability and robustness in biomolecular systems	2007.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']		The need to perform sophisticated information processing in an environment that is variable and noisy restricts the functional design of biological networks.

Expression noise and acetylation profiles distinguish HDAC functions	2012.0	['Leehee Weinberger', 'Yoav Voichek', 'Itay Tirosh', 'Gil Hornung', 'Ido Amit', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular cell	Gene expression shows a significant variation (noise) between genetically identical cells. Noise depends on the gene expression process regulated by the chromatin environment. We screened for chromatin factors that modulate noise in S. cerevisiae and analyzed the results using a theoretical model that infers regulatory mechanisms from the noise versus mean relationship. Distinct activities of the Rpd3(L) and Set3 histone deacetylase complexes were predicted. Both HDACs repressed expression. Yet, Rpd3(L)C decreased the frequency of transcriptional bursts, while Set3C decreased the burst size, as did H2B monoubiquitination (ubH2B). We mapped the acetylation of H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) upon deletion of multiple subunits of Set3C and Rpd3(L)C and of ubH2B effectors. ubH2B and Set3C appear to function in the same pathway to reduce the probability that an elongating PolII produces a functional transcript …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276512003917	109
Comparative analysis indicates regulatory neofunctionalization of yeast duplicates	2007.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome biology	Gene duplication provides raw material for the generation of new functions, but most duplicates are rapidly lost due to the initial redundancy in gene function. How gene function diversifies following duplication is largely unclear. Previous studies analyzed the diversification of duplicates by characterizing their coding sequence divergence. However, functional divergence can also be attributed to changes in regulatory properties, such as protein localization or expression, which require only minor changes in gene sequence. We developed a novel method to compare expression profiles from different organisms and applied it to analyze the expression divergence of yeast duplicated genes. The expression profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae duplicate pairs were compared with those of their pre-duplication orthologs in Candida albicans. Duplicate pairs were classified into two classes, corresponding to symmetric …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r50	104
Elucidating mechanisms underlying robustness of morphogen gradients	2004.0	['Avigdor Eldar', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']		Morphogen gradients play a pivotal role in most phases of developmental patterning. To ensure proper patterning, reproducible gradients are established under diverse environmental conditions and genetic backgrounds. We refer to the capacity to buffer fluctuations in gene dosage or environmental conditions as ‘robustness’. By theoretical analysis of mechanisms that facilitate robustness, it is possible to unravel the machinery responsible for generating the spatial distribution of morphogens.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X04000887	104
On the relation between promoter divergence and gene expression evolution	2008.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Adina Weinberger', 'Dana Bezalel', 'Mark Kaganovich', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	Recent studies have characterized significant differences in the cis‐regulatory sequences of related organisms, but the impact of these differences on gene expression remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that most previously identified differences in transcription factor (TF)‐binding sequences of yeasts and mammals have no detectable effect on gene expression, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms allow promoters to rapidly evolve while maintaining a stabilized expression pattern. To examine the impact of changes in cis‐regulatory elements in a more controlled setting, we compared the genes induced during mating of three yeast species. This response is governed by a single TF (STE12), and variations in its predicted binding sites can indeed account for about half of the observed expression differences. The remaining unexplained differences are correlated with the increased divergence of the …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb4100198	102
Expression homeostasis during DNA replication	2016.0	['Yoav Voichek', 'Raz Bar-ziv', 'Naama Barkai']	Science	Genome replication introduces a stepwise increase in the DNA template available for transcription. Genes replicated early in S phase experience this increase before late-replicating genes, raising the question of how expression levels are affected by DNA replication. We show that in budding yeast, messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis rate is buffered against changes in gene dosage during S phase. This expression homeostasis depends on acetylation of H3 on its internal K56 site by Rtt109/Asf1. Deleting these factors, mutating H3K56 or up-regulating its deacetylation, increases gene expression in S phase in proportion to gene replication timing. Therefore, H3K56 acetylation on newly deposited histones reduces transcription efficiency from replicated DNA, complementing its role in guarding genome stability. Our study provides molecular insight into the mechanism maintaining expression homeostasis during …	https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aad1162	98
Morphogen gradient formation in a complex environment: an anomalous diffusion model	2005.0	['Gil Hornung', 'Brian Berkowitz', 'Naama Barkai']	Physical review e	Current models of morphogen-induced patterning assume that morphogens undergo normal, or Fickian, diffusion, although the validity of this assumption has never been examined. Here we argue that the interaction of morphogens with the complex extracellular surrounding may lead to anomalous diffusion. We present a phenomenological model that captures this interaction, and derive the properties of the morphogen profile under conditions of anomalous (non-Fickian) diffusion. In this context we consider the continuous time random walk formalism and extend its application to account for degradation of morphogen particles. We show that within the anomalous diffusion model, morphogen profiles are fundamentally distinct from the corresponding Fickian profiles. Differences were found in several key aspects, including the role of degradation in determining the profile, the rate by which it spreads in time and its …	https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.72.041916	96
Threshold responses to morphogen gradients by zero‐order ultrasensitivity	2005.0	['Gustavo J Melen', 'Sagi Levy', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ben‐zion Shilo']	Molecular systems biology	Translating a graded morphogen distribution into tight response borders is central to all developmental processes. Yet, the molecular mechanisms generating such behavior are poorly understood. During patterning of the Drosophila embryonic ventral ectoderm, a graded mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is converted into an all‐or‐none degradation switch of the Yan transcriptional repressor. Replacing the cardinal phosphorylated amino acid of Yan by a phosphomimetic residue allowed its degradation in a MAPK‐independent manner, consistent with Yan phosphorylation being the critical event in generating the switch. Several alternative threshold mechanisms that could, in principle, be realized by this phosphorylation, including first order, cooperativity, positive feedback and zero‐order ultrasensitivity, were analyzed. We found that they can be distinguished by their kinetics and steady‐state …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb4100036	96
Epigenetically-inherited centromere and neocentromere DNA replicates earliest in S-phase	2010.0	['Amnon Koren', 'Hung-ji Tsai', 'Itay Tirosh', 'Laura S Burrack', 'Naama Barkai', 'Judith Berman']	Plos genetics	Eukaryotic centromeres are maintained at specific chromosomal sites over many generations. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeres are genetic elements defined by a DNA sequence that is both necessary and sufficient for function; whereas, in most other eukaryotes, centromeres are maintained by poorly characterized epigenetic mechanisms in which DNA has a less definitive role. Here we use the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans as a model organism to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. By determining the genome-wide replication timing program of the C. albicans genome, we discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. Importantly, epigenetic formation of new ectopic centromeres (neocentromeres) was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, such that a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components. Furthermore, changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions, further supporting the idea that centromere proteins determine origin activity. Finally, analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. This strand-biased pattern is conserved, together with centromere position, among related strains and species, in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence. Thus, inheritance of centromere position is correlated with a constitutively active origin …	https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001068	92
Protease helps yeast find mating partners	1998.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Mark D Rose', 'Ned S Wingreen']	Nature	The choice of mating partner by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the detection of mating pheromones produced by other yeast cells. A cell that is capable of mating deduces the position of its nearest mating partner from the spatial gradient of pheromone. While studying this process, we realized that, in the presence of many potential mating partners, the gradient might not point in the direction of the nearest partner. Here we show that degradation of some of the mating pheromone by protease enzymes helps to align the gradient in the direction of the nearest partner, which increases mating efficiency.	https://www.nature.com/articles/24760	92
Scaling of morphogen gradients	2011.0	['Danny Ben-zvi', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']		Individuals of the same or closely related species can vary substantially in size. Still, the proportions within and between tissues are precisely kept. This adaptation of pattern with size termed scaling, is receiving a growing attention. We review experimental evidence for scaling, and describe theoretical models for mechanisms that scale morphogen gradients. We particularly note the Expansion–Repression mechanism, in which a diffusible molecule that positively regulates the morphogen gradient width is repressed by morphogen signaling. The Expansion–Repression circuit provides scaling in a robust manner and is readily implemented by a host of molecular mechanisms. We suggest means for identifying such a circuit in a system of interest.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X11001237	86
Divergence of nucleosome positioning between two closely related yeast species: genetic basis and functional consequences	2010.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Nadejda Sigal', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	Gene regulation differs greatly between related species, constituting a major source of phenotypic diversity. Recent studies characterized extensive differences in the gene expression programs of closely related species. In contrast, virtually nothing is known about the evolution of chromatin structure and how it influences the divergence of gene expression. Here, we compare the genome‐wide nucleosome positioning of two closely related yeast species and, by profiling their inter‐specific hybrid, trace the genetic basis of the observed differences into mutations affecting the local DNA sequences (cis effects) or the upstream regulators (trans effects). The majority (∼70%) of inter‐species differences is due to cis effects, leaving a significant contribution (30%) for trans factors. We show that cis effects are well explained by mutations in nucleosome‐disfavoring AT‐rich sequences, but are not associated with divergence …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb.2010.20	85
DNA crossover motifs associated with epigenetic modifications delineate open chromatin regions in Arabidopsis	2015.0	['Shay Shilo', 'Cathy Melamed-bessudo', 'Yanniv Dorone', 'Naama Barkai', 'Avraham A Levy']	The plant cell	The rate of crossover, the reciprocal exchanges of homologous chromosomal segments, is not uniform along chromosomes differing between male and female meiocytes. To better understand the factors regulating this variable landscape, we performed a detailed genetic and epigenetic analysis of 737 crossover events in Arabidopsis thaliana. Crossovers were more frequent than expected in promoters. Three DNA motifs enriched in crossover regions and less abundant in crossover-poor pericentric regions were identified. One of these motifs, the CCN repeat, was previously unknown in plants. The A-rich motif was preferentially associated with promoters, while the CCN repeat and the CTT repeat motifs were preferentially associated with genes. Analysis of epigenetic modifications around the motifs showed, in most cases, a specific epigenetic architecture. For example, we show that there is a peak of …	https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/27/9/2427/6096054	82
The DCX superfamily 1: common and divergent roles for members of the mouse DCX superfamily	2006.0	['Frédéric M Coquelle', 'Talia Levy', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Sharon Grayer Wolf', 'Daniela Bar-el', 'Tamar Sapir', 'Yehuda Brody', 'Irit Orr', 'Naama Barkai', 'Gregor Eichele', 'Orly Reiner']	Cell cycle	The doublecortin-like (DCX) domains serve as protein-interaction platforms. DCXtandem domains appear in the product of the X-linked doublecortin (DCX) gene, inretinitis pigmentosa –1 (RP1), as well as in other gene products. Mutations in the humanDCX gene are associated with abnormal neuronal migration, epilepsy, and mentalretardation; mutations in RP1 are associated with a form of inherited blindness, whileDCDC2 has been associated with dyslectic reading disabilities. Motivated by the possibleimportance of this gene family, a thorough analysis to detect all family members in themouse was conducted. The DCX-repeat gene superfamily is composed of elevenparalogs, and we cloned the DCX domains from nine different genes. Our studyquestioned which functions attributed to the DCX domain, are conserved among thedifferent members. Our results suggest that the proteins with the DCX-domain …	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cc.5.9.2715	81
Intrinsically disordered regions direct transcription factor in vivo binding specificity	2020.0	['Sagie Brodsky', 'Tamar Jana', 'Karin Mittelman', 'Michal Chapal', 'Divya Krishna Kumar', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular cell	Transcription factors (TFs) that bind common DNA motifs in vitro occupy distinct sets of promoters in vivo, raising the question of how binding specificity is achieved. TFs are enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions commonly form promiscuous interactions, yet their unique properties might also benefit specific binding-site selection. We examine this using Msn2 and Yap1, TFs of distinct families that contain long IDRs outside their DNA-binding domains. We find that these IDRs are both necessary and sufficient for localizing to the majority of target promoters. This IDR-directed binding does not depend on any localized domain but results from a multitude of weak determinants distributed throughout the entire IDR sequence. Furthermore, IDR specificity is conserved between distant orthologs, suggesting direct interaction with multiple promoters. We propose that distribution of sensing …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109727652030352X	79
Strategy of transcription regulation in the budding yeast	2007.0	['Sagi Levy', 'Jan Ihmels', 'Miri Carmi', 'Adina Weinberger', 'Gilgi Friedlander', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos one	Cells must adjust their gene expression in order to compete in a constantly changing environment. Two alternative strategies could in principle ensure optimal coordination of gene expression with physiological requirements. First, characters of the internal physiological state, such as growth rate, metabolite levels, or energy availability, could be feedback to tune gene expression. Second, internal needs could be inferred from the external environment, using evolutionary-tuned signaling pathways. Coordination of ribosomal biogenesis with the requirement for protein synthesis is of particular importance, since cells devote a large fraction of their biosynthetic capacity for ribosomal biogenesis. To define the relative contribution of internal vs. external sensing to the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis gene expression in yeast, we subjected S. cerevisiae cells to conditions which decoupled the actual vs. environmentally-expected growth rate. Gene expression followed the environmental signal according to the expected, but not the actual, growth rate. Simultaneous monitoring of gene expression and growth rate in continuous cultures further confirmed that ribosome biogenesis genes responded rapidly to changes in the environments but were oblivious to longer-term changes in growth rate. Our results suggest that the capacity to anticipate and prepare for environmentally-mediated changes in cell growth presented a major selection force during yeast evolution.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000250	79
The competitive advantage of a dual-transporter system	2011.0	['Sagi Levy', 'Moshe Kafri', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Science	Cells use transporters of different affinities to regulate nutrient influx. When nutrients are depleted, low-affinity transporters are replaced by high-affinity ones. High-affinity transporters are helpful when concentrations of nutrients are low, but the advantage of reducing their abundance when nutrients are abundant is less clear. When we eliminated such reduced production of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae high-affinity transporters for phosphate and zinc, the elapsed time from the initiation of the starvation program until the lack of nutrients limited growth was shortened, and recovery from starvation was delayed. The latter phenotype was rescued by constitutive activation of the starvation program. Dual-transporter systems appear to prolong preparation for starvation and to facilitate subsequent recovery, which may optimize sensing of nutrient depletion by integrating internal and external information about nutrient …	https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1207154	78
Linking the signaling cascades and dynamic regulatory networks controlling stress responses	2013.0	['Anthony Gitter', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ziv Bar-joseph']	Genome research	Accurate models of the cross-talk between signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks within cells are essential to understand complex response programs. We present a new computational method that combines condition-specific time-series expression data with general protein interaction data to reconstruct dynamic and causal stress response networks. These networks characterize the pathways involved in the response, their time of activation, and the affected genes. The signaling and regulatory components of our networks are linked via a set of common transcription factors that serve as targets in the signaling network and as regulators of the transcriptional response network. Detailed case studies of stress responses in budding yeast demonstrate the predictive power of our method. Our method correctly identifies the core signaling proteins and transcription factors of the response programs. It …	https://genome.cshlp.org/content/23/2/365.short	77
The pattern and evolution of yeast promoter bendability	2007.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Judith Berman', 'Naama Barkai']		In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcription factor binding sites are found preferentially ∼100–200 bp upstream of the start codon. Here, we show that this region is associated with rigid DNA in promoters lacking a TATA box, but not in TATA-containing promoters. The association of rigid DNA with transcription factor binding sites is conserved in TATA-less promoters from 11 yeast species, whereas the position of the rigid DNA varies substantially among species. Rigid DNA could influence nucleosome positioning and assist in the assembly of the transcriptional machinery at TATA-less promoters.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952507001187	77
Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule	2014.0	['Inna Averbukh', 'Danny Ben-zvi', 'Siddhartha Mishra', 'Naama Barkai']	Development	Morphogen gradients guide the patterning of tissues and organs during the development of multicellular organisms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for tissue growth. The consequences of this interplay between growth and patterning are not well understood. In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides patterning and is also required for tissue growth. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen gradient formation in a growing tissue, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen gradient scales with the growing tissue size, tissue growth …	https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article-abstract/141/10/2150/46008	76
MRC1-dependent scaling of the budding yeast DNA replication timing program	2010.0	['Amnon Koren', 'Ilya Soifer', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome research	We describe the DNA replication timing programs of 14 yeast mutants with an extended S phase identified by a novel genome-wide screen. These mutants are associated with the DNA replication machinery, cell-cycle control, and dNTP synthesis and affect different parts of S phase. In 13 of the mutants, origin activation time scales with the duration of S phase. A limited number of origins become inactive in these strains, with inactive origins characterized by small replicons and distributed throughout S phase. In sharp contrast, cells deleted of MRC1, a gene implicated in replication fork stabilization and in the replication checkpoint pathway, maintained wild-type firing times despite over twofold lengthening of S phase. Numerous dormant origins were activated in this mutant. Our data suggest that most perturbations that lengthen S phase affect the entire program of replication timing, rather than a specific subset of …	https://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/6/781.short	76
Widespread remodeling of mid-coding sequence nucleosomes by Isw1	2010.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Nadejda Sigal', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome biology	The positions of nucleosomes along eukaryotic DNA are defined by the local DNA sequence and are further tuned by the activity of chromatin remodelers. While the genome-wide effect of most remodelers has not been described, recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that Isw2 prevents ectopic expression of anti-sense and suppressed transcripts at gene ends. We examined the genome-wide function of the Isw2 homologue, Isw1, by mapping nucleosome positioning in S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus strains deleted of ISW1. We found that Isw1 functions primarily within coding regions of genes, consistent with its putative role in transcription elongation. Upon deletion of ISW1, mid-coding nucleosomes were shifted upstream (towards the 5' ends) in about half of the genes. Isw1-dependent shifts were correlated with trimethylation of H3K79 and were enriched at genes with internal cryptic initiation sites. Our results suggest a division of labor between Isw1 and Isw2, whereby Isw2 maintains repressive chromatin structure at gene ends while Isw1 has a similar function at mid-coding regions. The differential specificity of the two remodelers may be specified through interactions with particular histone marks.	https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-5-r49	76
Robust generation and decoding of morphogen gradients	2009.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']		Morphogen gradients play a key role in multiple differentiation processes. Both the formation of the gradient and its interpretation by the receiving cells need to occur at high precision to ensure reproducible patterning. This need for quantitative precision is challenged by fluctuations in the environmental conditions and by variations in the genetic makeup of the developing embryos. We discuss mechanisms that buffer morphogen profiles against variations in gene dosage. Self-enhanced morphogen degradation and pre-steady-state decoding provide general means for buffering the morphogen profile against fluctuations in morphogen production rate. A more specific “shuttling” mechanism, which establishes a sharp and robust activation profile of a widely expressed morphogen, and enables the adjustment of morphogen profile with embryo size, is also described. Finally, we consider the transformation of the …	https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/1/5/a001990.short	75
Modulation of the transcription regulatory program in yeast cells committed to sporulation	2006.0	['Gilgi Friedlander', 'Daphna Joseph-strauss', 'Miri Carmi', 'Drora Zenvirth', 'Giora Simchen', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome biology	Meiosis in budding yeast is coupled to the process of sporulation, where the four haploid nuclei are packaged into a gamete. This differentiation process is characterized by a point of transition, termed commitment, when it becomes independent of the environment. Not much is known about the mechanisms underlying commitment, but it is often assumed that positive feedback loops stabilize the underlying gene-expression cascade. We describe the gene-expression program of committed cells. Sporulating cells were transferred back to growth medium at different stages of the process, and their transcription response was characterized. Most sporulation-induced genes were immediately downregulated upon transfer, even in committed cells that continued to sporulate. Focusing on the metabolic-related transcription response, we observed that pre-committed cells, as well as mature spores, responded to the transfer to growth medium in essentially the same way that vegetative cells responded to glucose. In contrast, committed cells elicited a dramatically different response. Our results suggest that cells ensure commitment to sporulation not by stabilizing the process, but by modulating their gene-expression program in an active manner. This unique transcriptional program may optimize sporulation in an environment-specific manner.	https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2006-7-3-r20	74
Evaluating putative mechanisms of the mitotic spindle checkpoint	2005.0	['Andreas Doncic', 'Eshel Ben-jacob', 'Naama Barkai']	Proceedings of the national academy of sciences	The mitotic spindle checkpoint halts the cell cycle until all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindles. Evidence suggests that the checkpoint prevents cell-cycle progression by inhibiting the activity of the APC-Cdc20 complex, but the precise mechanism underlying this inhibition is not yet known. Here, we use mathematical modeling to compare several mechanisms that could account for this inhibition. We describe the interplay between the capacities to strongly inhibit cell-cycle progression before spindle attachment on one hand and to rapidly resume cell-cycle progression once the last kinetochore is attached on the other hand. We find that inhibition that is restricted to the kinetochore region is not sufficient for supporting both requirements when realistic diffusion constants are considered. A mechanism that amplifies the checkpoint signal through autocatalyzed inhibition is also insufficient. In contrast …	https://www.pnas.org/content/102/18/6332.short	74
Error minimization in lateral inhibition circuits	2010.0	['Omer Barad', 'Dalia Rosin', 'Eran Hornstein', 'Naama Barkai']	Science signaling	The pattern of the sensory bristles in the fruit fly Drosophila is remarkably reproducible. Each bristle arises from a sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell that is selected, through a lateral inhibition process, from a cluster of proneural cells. Although this process is well characterized, the mechanism ensuring its robustness remains obscure. Using probabilistic modeling, we defined the sources of error in SOP selection and examined how they depend on the underlying molecular circuit. We found that rapid inhibition of the neural differentiation of nonselected cells, coupled with high cell-to-cell variability in the timing of selection, is crucial for accurate SOP selection. Cell-autonomous interactions (cis interactions) between the Notch receptor and its ligands Delta or Serrate facilitate accurate SOP selection by shortening the effective delay between the time when the inhibitory signal is initiated in one cell and the time when it …	https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scisignal.2000857	72
Evolution of gene sequence and gene expression are not correlated in yeast	2008.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Naama Barkai']		We show that, in yeast, the divergence rate of gene expression is not correlated with that of its associated coding sequence. Gene essentiality influences both modes of evolution, but other properties related to protein structure or promoter composition are only correlated with coding-sequence divergence or gene expression divergence, respectively. Based on these findings, we discuss the possibilities of neutral evolution of gene expression and of different modes of evolution in unicellular versus multicellular organisms.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016895250800005X	71
The design of transcription-factor binding sites is affected by combinatorial regulation	2005.0	['Yonatan Bilu', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome biology	Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to specific cis-regulatory elements in gene promoters. Although DNA sequences that serve as transcription-factor binding sites have been characterized and associated with the regulation of numerous genes, the principles that govern the design and evolution of such sites are poorly understood. Using the comprehensive mapping of binding-site locations available in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we examined possible factors that may have an impact on binding-site design. We found that binding sites tend to be shorter and fuzzier when they appear in promoter regions that bind multiple transcription factors. We further found that essential genes bind relatively fewer transcription factors, as do divergent promoters. We provide evidence that novel binding sites tend to appear in specific promoters that are already associated with multiple sites. Two principal …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2005-6-12-r103	71
Systematic identification of cell size regulators in budding yeast	2014.0	['Ilya Soifer', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	Cell size is determined by a complex interplay between growth and division, involving multiple cellular pathways. To identify systematically processes affecting size control in G1 in budding yeast, we imaged and analyzed the cell cycle of millions of individual cells representing 591 mutants implicated in size control. Quantitative metric distinguished mutants affecting the mechanism of size control from the majority of mutants that have a perturbed size due to indirect effects modulating cell growth. Overall, we identified 17 negative and dozens positive size control regulators, with the negative regulators forming a small network centered on elements of mitotic exit network. Some elements of the translation machinery affected size control with a notable distinction between the deletions of parts of small and large ribosomal subunit: parts of small ribosomal subunit tended to regulate size control, while parts of the large …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/msb.20145345	67
Chromatin regulators as capacitors of interspecies variations in gene expression	2010.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Sharon Reikhav', 'Nadejda Sigal', 'Yael Assia', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	Gene expression varies widely between closely related species and strains, yet the genetic basis of most differences is still unknown. Several studies suggested that chromatin regulators have a key role in generating expression diversity, predicting a reduction in the interspecies differences on deletion of genes that influence chromatin structure or modifications. To examine this, we compared the genome‐wide expression profiles of two closely related yeast species following the individual deletions of eight chromatin regulators and one transcription factor. In all cases, regulator deletions increased, rather than decreased, the expression differences between the species, revealing hidden genetic variability that was masked in the wild‐type backgrounds. This effect was not observed for individual deletions of 11 enzymes involved in central metabolic pathways. The buffered variations were associated with trans …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb.2010.84	60
Spore germination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: global gene expression patterns and cell cycle landmarks	2007.0	['Daphna Joseph-strauss', 'Drora Zenvirth', 'Giora Simchen', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome biology	Spore germination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a process in which non-dividing haploid spores re-enter the mitotic cell cycle and resume vegetative growth. To study the signals and pathways underlying spore germination we examined the global changes in gene expression and followed cell-cycle and germination markers during this process. We find that the germination process can be divided into two distinct stages. During the first stage, the induced spores respond only to glucose. The transcription program during this stage recapitulates the general transcription response of yeast cells to glucose. Only during the second phase are the cells able to sense and respond to other nutritional components in the environment. Components of the mitotic machinery are involved in spore germination but in a distinct pattern. In contrast to the mitotic cell cycle, growth-related events during germination are not …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2007-8-11-r241	58

Conservation among species greatly assists the detection and characterization of functional elements, whereas inter-species differences are probably the best indicators of biological adaptation. Traditionally, comparative approaches were applied to the analysis of genomic sequences. With the growing availability of functional genomic data, comparative paradigms are now being extended also to the study of other functional attributes, most notably the gene expression. Here we review recent works applying comparative analysis to large-scale gene expression datasets and discuss the central principles and challenges of such approaches.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166907000857	57
Self-organized shuttling: generating sharp dorsoventral polarity in the early Drosophila embryo	2012.0	['Michal Haskel-ittah', 'Danny Ben-zvi', 'Merav Branski-arieli', 'Eyal D Schejter', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']	Cell	Morphogen gradients pattern tissues and organs during development. When morphogen production is spatially restricted, diffusion and degradation are sufficient to generate sharp concentration gradients. It is less clear how sharp gradients can arise within the source of a broadly expressed morphogen. A recent solution relies on localized production of an inhibitor outside the domain of morphogen production, which effectively redistributes (shuttles) and concentrates the morphogen within its expression domain. Here, we study how a sharp gradient is established without a localized inhibitor, focusing on early dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo, where an active ligand and its inhibitor are concomitantly generated in a broad ventral domain. Using theory and experiments, we show that a sharp Toll activation gradient is produced through “self-organized shuttling,” which dynamically relocalizes inhibitor …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412009270	53
Coordination of gene expression with growth rate: a feedback or a feed-forward strategy?	2009.0	['Sagi Levy', 'Naama Barkai']		In the budding yeast, a large fraction of genes is coordinately regulated with growth rate. We argue that this correlation does not reflect a direct feedback from growth rate to gene expression. Rather, what appears to be a response to growth rate is dominated by environmental sensing. External parameters, such as nutrition or temperature, feed-forward to define gene expression pattern that is tuned to the evolutionary-predicted growth rate. While such a feed-forward strategy requires fine-tuning of signaling mechanisms, and is limited in the range of environments that can be monitored, it enables advanced preparation to physiological changes that predictably occur following environmental switching. The capacity to anticipate and prepare for changing conditions was probably a major selection force during yeast evolution.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579309008631	53
Chromatin dynamics during DNA replication	2016.0	['Raz Bar-ziv', 'Yoav Voichek', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome research	Chromatin is composed of DNA and histones, which provide a unified platform for regulating DNA-related processes, mostly through their post-translational modification. During DNA replication, histone arrangement is perturbed, first to allow progression of DNA polymerase and then during repackaging of the replicated DNA. To study how DNA replication influences the pattern of histone modification, we followed the cell-cycle dynamics of 10 histone marks in budding yeast. We find that histones deposited on newly replicated DNA are modified at different rates: While some marks appear immediately upon replication (e.g., H4K16ac, H3K4me1), others increase with transcription-dependent delays (e.g., H3K4me3, H3K36me3).

‘Big frog, small frog’– maintaining proportions in embryonic development: Delivered on 2 July 2008 at the 33rd FEBS Congress in Athens, Greece	2009.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Danny Ben‐zvi']	The febs journal	We discuss mechanisms that enable the scaling of pattern with size during the development of multicellular organisms. Recently, we analyzed scaling in the context of the early Xenopus embryo, focusing on the determination of the dorsal–ventral axis by a gradient of BMP activation. The ability of this system to withstand extreme perturbation was exemplified in classical experiments performed by Hans Spemann in the early 20th century. Quantitative analysis revealed that patterning is governed by a noncanonical ‘shuttling‐based’ mechanism, and defined the feedback enabling the scaling of pattern with size. Robust scaling is due to molecular implementation of an integral‐feedback controller, which adjusts the width of the BMP morphogen gradient with the size of the system. We present an ‘expansion–repression’ feedback topology which generalizes this concept for a wider range of patterning systems, providing …	https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06854.x	44
Conservation of expression and sequence of metabolic genes is reflected by activity across metabolic states	2006.0	['Yonatan Bilu', 'Tomer Shlomi', 'Naama Barkai', 'Eytan Ruppin']	Plos computational biology	Variation in gene expression levels on a genomic scale has been detected among different strains, among closely related species, and within populations of genetically identical cells. What are the driving forces that lead to expression divergence in some genes and conserved expression in others? Here we employ flux balance analysis to address this question for metabolic genes. We consider the genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its entire space of optimal and near-optimal flux distributions. We show that this space reveals underlying evolutionary constraints on expression regulation, as well as on the conservation of the underlying gene sequences. Genes that have a high range of optimal flux levels tend to display divergent expression levels among different yeast strains and species. This suggests that gene regulation has diverged in those parts of the metabolic network that are less constrained. In addition, we show that genes that are active in a large fraction of the space of optimal solutions tend to have conserved sequences. This supports the possibility that there is less selective pressure to maintain genes that are relevant for only a small number of metabolic states.	https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020106	43
Computational verification of protein-protein interactions by orthologous co-expression	2005.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Naama Barkai']	Bmc bioinformatics	High-throughput methods identify an overwhelming number of protein-protein interactions. However, the limited accuracy of these methods results in the false identification of many spurious interactions. Accordingly, the resulting interactions are regarded as hypothetical and computational methods are needed to increase their confidence. Several methods have recently been suggested for this purpose including co-expression as a confidence measure for interacting proteins, but their performance is still quite poor. We introduce a novel computational method for verification of protein-protein interactions based on the co-expression of orthologs of interacting partners. The performance of our method is analysed using known S. cerevisiae interactions, and is shown to overcome limitations of previous methods. We present specific examples of known and putative interactions that are detected by our method and not by …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2105-6-40	43
Robust selection of sensory organ precursors by the Notch–Delta pathway	2011.0	['Omer Barad', 'Eran Hornstein', 'Naama Barkai']		The patterning of multicellular organisms is robust to environmental, genetic, or stochastic fluctuations. Mathematical modeling is instrumental in identifying mechanisms supporting this robustness. The principle of lateral inhibition, whereby a differentiating cell inhibits its neighbors from adopting the same fate, is frequently used for selecting a single cell out of a cluster of equipotent cells. For example, Sensory Organ Precursors (SOP) in the fruit-fly Drosophila implement lateral inhibition by activating the Notch–Delta pathway. We discuss parameters affecting the rate of errors in this process, and the mechanism (inhibitory cis interaction between Notch and Delta) predicted to reduce this error.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955067411001219	41
Creating gradients by morphogen shuttling	2013.0	['Ben-zion Shilo', 'Michal Haskel-ittah', 'Danny Ben-zvi', 'Eyal D Schejter', 'Naama Barkai']		Morphogen gradients are used to pattern a field of cells according to variations in the concentration of a signaling molecule. Typically, the morphogen emanates from a confined group of cells. During early embryogenesis, however, the ability to define a restricted source for morphogen production is limited. Thus, various early patterning systems rely on a broadly expressed morphogen that generates an activation gradient within its expression domain. Computational and experimental work has shed light on how a sharp and robust gradient can be established under those situations, leading to a mechanism termed ‘morphogen shuttling’. This mechanism relies on an extracellular shuttling molecule that forms an inert, highly diffusible complex with the morphogen. Morphogen release from the complex following cleavage of the shuttling molecule by an extracellular protease leads to the accumulation of free ligand at …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952513000024	40
Dynamic lineage priming is driven via direct enhancer regulation by ERK	2019.0	['William B Hamilton', 'Yaron Mosesson', 'Rita S Monteiro', 'Kristina B Emdal', 'Teresa E Knudsen', 'Chiara Francavilla', 'Naama Barkai', 'Jesper V Olsen', 'Joshua M Brickman']	Nature	Central to understanding cellular behaviour in multi-cellular organisms is the question of how a cell exits one transcriptional state to adopt and eventually become committed to another. Fibroblast growth factor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (FGF-ERK) signalling drives differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and pre-implantation embryos towards primitive endoderm, and inhibiting ERK supports ES cell self-renewal 1. Paracrine FGF–ERK signalling induces heterogeneity, whereby cells reversibly progress from pluripotency towards primitive endoderm while retaining their capacity to re-enter self-renewal 2. Here we find that ERK reversibly regulates transcription in ES cells by directly affecting enhancer activity without requiring a change in transcription factor binding. ERK triggers the reversible association and disassociation of RNA polymerase II and associated co-factors from genes and …	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1732-z	38

Robust amplification in adaptive signal transduction networks	2001.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Uri Alon', 'Stanislas Leibler']	Comptes rendus de l'académie des sciences-series iv-physics-astrophysics	Amplification of small changes in input signals is an essential feature of many biological signal transduction systems. An important problem is how sensitivity amplification can be reconciled with wide dynamic range of response. Here a general molecular mechanism is proposed, in which both high amplification and wide dynamic range of a sensory system is obtained, and this without fine-tuning of biochemical parameters. The amplification mechanism is based on inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the sensory complex. As an example, we show how this ‘inhibition-driven amplification’ mechanism might function in the bacterial chemotaxis network, where it could explain several intriguing experimental observations connected with the existence of high gain, wide dynamic range and robust adaptation.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296214701012306	37
Extensive divergence of yeast stress responses through transitions between induced and constitutive activation	2011.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Koon Ho Wong', 'Naama Barkai', 'Kevin Struhl']	Proceedings of the national academy of sciences	Closely related species show a high degree of differences in gene expression, but the functional significance of these differences remains unclear. Similarly, stress responses in yeast typically involve differential expression of numerous genes, and it is unclear how many of these are functionally significant. To address these issues, we compared the expression programs of four yeast species under different growth conditions, and found that the response of these species to stress has diverged extensively. On an individual gene basis, most transcriptional responses are not conserved in any pair of species, and there are very limited common responses among all four species. We present evidence that many evolutionary changes in stress responses are compensated either (i) by the response of related genes or (ii) by changes in the basal expression levels of the genes whose responses have diverged. Thus, stress …	https://www.pnas.org/content/108/40/16693.short	36
Coupling phenotypic persistence to DNA damage increases genetic diversity in severe stress	2017.0	['Gilad Yaakov', 'David Lerner', 'Kajetan Bentele', 'Joseph Steinberger', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature ecology & evolution	Mutation rate balances the need to protect genome integrity with the advantage of evolutionary innovations. Microorganisms increase their mutation rate when stressed, perhaps addressing the growing need for evolutionary innovation. Such a strategy, however, is only beneficial under moderate stresses that allow cells to divide and realize their mutagenic potential. In contrast, severe stresses rapidly kill the majority of the population with the exception of a small minority of cells that are in a phenotypically distinct state termed persistence. Although persisters were discovered many decades ago, the stochastic event triggering persistence is poorly understood. We report that spontaneous DNA damage triggers persistence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by activating the general stress response, providing protection against a range of harsh stress and drug environments. We further show that the persister subpopulation …	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-016-0016	35
The evolutionary potential of phenotypic mutations	2015.0	['Hayato Yanagida', 'Ariel Gispan', 'Noam Kadouri', 'Shelly Rozen', 'Michal Sharon', 'Naama Barkai', 'Dan S Tawfik']	Plos genetics	Errors in protein synthesis, so-called phenotypic mutations, are orders-of-magnitude more frequent than genetic mutations. Here, we provide direct evidence that alternative protein forms and phenotypic variability derived from translational errors paved the path to genetic, evolutionary adaptations via gene duplication. We explored the evolutionary origins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IDP3 - an NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase mediating fatty acids ß-oxidation in the peroxisome. Following the yeast whole genome duplication, IDP3 diverged from a cytosolic ancestral gene by acquisition of a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal. We discovered that the pre-duplicated cytosolic IDPs are partially localized to the peroxisome owing to +1 translational frameshifts that bypass the stop codon and unveil cryptic peroxisomal targeting signals within the 3’-UTR. Exploring putative cryptic signals in all 3’-UTRs of yeast genomes, we found that other enzymes related to NADPH production such as pyruvate carboxylase 1 (PYC1) might be prone to peroxisomal localization via cryptic signals. Using laboratory evolution we found that these translational frameshifts are rapidly imprinted via genetic single base deletions occurring within the very same gene location. Further, as exemplified here, the sequences that promote translational frameshifts are also more prone to genetic deletions. Thus, genotypes conferring higher phenotypic variability not only meet immediate challenges by unveiling cryptic 3’-UTR sequences, but also boost the potential for future genetic adaptations.	https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005445	35
Autocorrelation analysis reveals widespread spatial biases in microarray experiments	2007.0	['Amnon Koren', 'Itay Tirosh', 'Naama Barkai']	Bmc genomics	DNA microarrays provide the ability to interrogate multiple genes in a single experiment and have revolutionized genomic research. However, the microarray technology suffers from various forms of biases and relatively low reproducibility. A particular source of false data has been described, in which non-random placement of gene probes on the microarray surface is associated with spurious correlations between genes. In order to assess the prevalence of this effect and better understand its origins, we applied an autocorrelation analysis of the relationship between chromosomal position and expression level to a database of over 2000 individual yeast microarray experiments. We show that at least 60% of these experiments exhibit spurious chromosomal position-dependent gene correlations, which nonetheless appear in a stochastic manner within each experimental dataset. Using computer simulations, we show that large spatial biases caused in the microarray hybridization step and independently of printing procedures can exclusively account for the observed spurious correlations, in contrast to previous suggestions. Our data suggest that such biases may generate more than 15% false data per experiment. Importantly, spatial biases are expected to occur regardless of microarray design and over a wide range of microarray platforms, organisms and experimental procedures. Spatial biases comprise a major source of noise in microarray studies; revision of routine experimental practices and normalizations to account for these biases may significantly and comprehensively improve the quality of new as well as existing DNA microarray data.	https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-8-164	35
Inferring regulatory mechanisms from patterns of evolutionary divergence	2011.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	The number of sequenced species is increasing at a staggering rate, calling for new approaches for incorporating evolutionary information in the study of biological mechanisms. Evolutionary conservation is widely used for assigning a function to new proteins and for predicting functional coding or non‐coding sequences. Here, we argue for a complementary approach that focuses on the divergence of regulatory programs. Regulatory mechanisms can be learned from patterns of evolutionary divergence in regulatory properties such as gene expression, transcription factor binding or nucleosome positioning. We review examples of this concept using yeast as a model system, and highlight a hybrid‐based approach that is highly instrumental in this analysis.	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb.2011.60	34
Rethinking cell growth models	2016.0	['Moshe Kafri', 'Eyal Metzl-raz', 'Felix Jonas', 'Naama Barkai']		The minimal description of a growing cell consists of self-replicating ribosomes translating the cellular proteome. While neglecting all other cellular components, this model provides key insights into the control and limitations of growth rate. It shows, for example, that growth rate is maximized when ribosomes work at full capacity, explains the linear relation between growth rate and the ribosome fraction of the proteome and defines the maximal possible growth rate. This ribosome-centered model also highlights the challenge of coordinating cell growth with related processes such as cell division or nutrient production. Coordination is promoted when ribosomes don't translate at maximal capacity, as it allows escaping strict exponential growth. Recent data support the notion that multiple cellular processes limit growth. In particular, increasing transcriptional demand may be as deleterious as increasing translational …	https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/article-abstract/16/7/fow081/2469915	33
Evolution of nucleosome occupancy: conservation of global properties and divergence of gene-specific patterns	2011.0	['Kyle Tsui', 'Sébastien Dubuis', 'Marinella Gebbia', 'Randall H Morse', 'Naama Barkai', 'Itay Tirosh', 'Corey Nislow']	Molecular and cellular biology	To examine the role of nucleosome occupancy in the evolution of gene expression, we measured the genome-wide nucleosome profiles of four yeast species, three belonging to the Saccharomyces sensu stricto lineage and the more distantly related Candida glabrata. Nucleosomes and associated promoter elements at C. glabrata genes are typically shifted upstream by ∼20 bp, compared to their orthologs from sensu stricto species. Nonetheless, all species display the same global organization features first described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a stereotypical nucleosome organization along genes and a division of promoters into those that contain or lack a pronounced nucleosome-depleted region (NDR), with the latter displaying a more dynamic pattern of gene expression. Despite this global similarity, however, nucleosome occupancy at specific genes diverged extensively between sensu stricto and C …	https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/mcb.05276-11	33
Budding yeast escape commitment to the phosphate starvation program using gene expression noise	2013.0	['Noam Vardi', 'Sagi Levy', 'Michael Assaf', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Current biology	Cells must rapidly adapt to changes in nutrient availability. In budding yeast, limitation of phosphate rapidly induces the expression of the Pho regulon genes [1, 2, 3, 4]. This starvation program depends on the transcription factor Pho4, which translocates to the nucleus within minutes when cells are transferred to a low-phosphate medium [5]. Contrasting its rapid induction, we report that the Pho regulon can remain induced for dozens of generations in cells transferred back to high phosphate levels. For example, about 40% of the cells that were starved for 2 hr maintained PHO4-dependent expression for over eleven generations of growing in high phosphate. This commitment to activation of the Pho regulon depends on two feedback loops that reduce internal phosphate, one through induction of the PHM1-4 genes that increase phosphate storage in the vacuoles and the second by induction of SPL2, which reduces …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221301049X	31
A repressor-decay timer for robust temporal patterning in embryonic Drosophila neuroblast lineages	2018.0	['Inna Averbukh', 'Sen-lin Lai', 'Chris Q Doe', 'Naama Barkai']	Elife	Biological timers synchronize patterning processes during embryonic development. In the Drosophila embryo, neural progenitors (neuroblasts; NBs) produce a sequence of unique neurons whose identities depend on the sequential expression of temporal transcription factors (TTFs). The stereotypy and precision of NB lineages indicate reproducible TTF timer progression. We combine theory and experiments to define the timer mechanism. The TTF timer is commonly described as a relay of activators, but its regulatory circuit is also consistent with a repressor-decay timer, where TTF expression begins when its repressor decays. Theory shows that repressor-decay timers are more robust to parameter variations than activator-relay timers. This motivated us to experimentally compare the relative importance of the relay and decay interactions in vivo. Comparing WT and mutant NBs at high temporal resolution, we show that the TTF sequence progresses primarily by repressor-decay. We suggest that need for robust performance shapes the evolutionary-selected designs of biological circuits.	https://elifesciences.org/articles/38631	30
Efficiency and specificity in microRNA biogenesis	2012.0	['Omer Barad', 'Mati Mann', 'Elik Chapnik', 'Archana Shenoy', 'Robert Blelloch', 'Naama Barkai', 'Eran Hornstein']	Nature structural & molecular biology	Primary microRNA cleavage by the Drosha–Dgcr8'Microprocessor'complex is critical for microRNA biogenesis. Yet, the Microprocessor may also cleave other nuclear RNAs in a nonspecific manner. We studied Microprocessor function using mathematical modeling and experiments in mouse and human tissues. We found that the autoregulatory feedback on Microprocessor expression is instrumental for balancing the efficiency and specificity of its activity by effectively tuning Microprocessor levels to those of its pri-miRNA substrate.	https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.2293	29
Buffering global variability of morphogen gradients	2017.0	['Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']		Morphogen gradients determine tissue pattern by triggering differential cell responses to distinct morphogen concentrations. The strict quantitative dependence of the emerging patterns on morphogen distribution raises the challenge of buffering variability in morphogen profile to ensure a reproducible outcome. We describe the underlying principles of two modules for buffering morphogen distribution: buffering morphogen amplitude by storing excess morphogen in a limited spatial region, and buffering morphogen spread by pinning morphogen levels at a distal position through global feedback that adjusts morphogen diffusion or degradation across the tissue. We also present concrete examples of patterning systems that implement these modules.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580716308760	28
Scaling of dorsal‐ventral patterning in the Xenopus laevis embryo	2014.0	['Danny Ben‐zvi', 'Abraham Fainsod', 'Ben‐zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']	Bioessays	Scaling of pattern with size has been described and studied for over a century, yet its molecular basis is understood in only a few cases. In a recent, elegant study, Inomata and colleagues proposed a new model explaining how bone morphogenic protein (BMP) activity gradient scales with embryo size in the early Xenopus laevis embryo. We discuss their results in conjunction with an alternative model we proposed previously. The expansion‐repression mechanism (ExR) provides a conceptual framework unifying both mechanisms. Results of Inomata and colleagues implicate the chordin‐stabilizing protein sizzled as the expander molecule enabling scaling, while we attributed this role to the BMP ligand Admp. The two expanders may work in concert, as suggested by the mathematical model of Inomata et al. We discuss approaches for differentiating the contribution of sizzled and Admp to pattern scaling.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bies.201300136	28
Hybrid vigor: the best of both parents, or a genomic clash?	2017.0	['Dana Bar-zvi', 'Offir Lupo', 'Avraham A Levy', 'Naama Barkai']		During evolution, mutations produce new lineages that gradually diverge in sequence and regulatory properties. Related strains or species can hybridize to produce viable offspring. Hybrids often outperform their parents, producing more biomass or growing more rapidly. This superior performance, termed heterosis, contrasts the more expected clash between the genomes, and has puzzled geneticists and evolutionary biologists for many years. In this review, we describe two classes of models explaining heterosis: the prevailing view attributes heterosis to rapid repair or enhancement of growth promoting pathways. An alternative view attributes heterosis to the impairment of growth-limiting pathways. The two classes are not mutually exclusive and can result from similar types of genetic interactions. We discuss the possible implications of heterosis on tradeoffs in species evolution.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452310017301300	27
Early commitment and robust differentiation in colonic crypts	2017.0	['Beáta Tóth', 'Shani Ben‐moshe', 'Avishai Gavish', 'Naama Barkai', 'Shalev Itzkovitz']	Molecular systems biology	Tissue stem cells produce a constant flux of differentiated cells with distinct proportions. Here, we show that stem cells in colonic crypts differentiate early to form precisely 1:3 ratio of secretory to absorptive cells. This precision is surprising, as there are only eight stem cells making irreversible fate decisions, and so large stochastic effects of this small pool should have yielded much larger noise in cell proportions. We use single molecule FISH, lineage‐tracing mice and simulations to identify the homeostatic mechanisms facilitating robust proportions. We find that Delta‐Notch lateral inhibition operates in a restricted spatial zone to reduce initial noise in cell proportions. Increased dwell time and dispersive migration of secretory cells further averages additional variability added during progenitor divisions and breaks up continuous patches of same‐fate cells. These noise‐reducing mechanisms resolve the trade‐off …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/msb.20167283	27
Resolving noise–control conflict by gene duplication	2019.0	['Michal Chapal', 'Sefi Mintzer', 'Sagie Brodsky', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos biology	Gene duplication promotes adaptive evolution in two main ways: allowing one duplicate to evolve a new function and splitting ancestral functions between the duplicates. The second scenario may resolve adaptive conflicts that can rise when one gene performs different functions. In an apparent departure from both scenarios, low-expressing transcription factor (TF) duplicates commonly bind to the same DNA motifs and act in overlapping conditions. To examine for possible benefits of this apparent redundancy, we examined the Msn2 and Msn4 duplicates in budding yeast. We show that Msn2,4 function as one unit by inducing the same set of target genes in overlapping conditions. Yet, the two-factor composition allows this unit’s expression to be both environmentally responsive and with low noise, resolving an adaptive conflict that limits expression of single genes. We propose that duplication can provide adaptive benefit through cooperation rather than functional divergence, allowing two-factor dynamics with beneficial properties that cannot be achieved by a single gene.	https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000289	26
Noise resistance in the spindle assembly checkpoint	2006.0	['Andreas Doncic', 'Eshel Ben‐jacob', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	Genetically identical cells vary in the amount of expressed proteins even when growing under the same conditions. It is not yet clear how cellular information processing copes with such stochastic fluctuations in protein levels. Here we examine the capacity of the spindle assembly checkpoint to buffer temporal fluctuations in the expression of Cdc20, a critical checkpoint target whose activity is inhibited to prevent premature cell cycle progression. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the checkpoint can buffer significant fluctuations in Cdc20 production rate. Critical to this buffering capacity is the use of sequestering‐based mechanism for inhibiting Cdc20, as apposed to inhibition by enhancing protein degradation. We propose that the design of biological networks is limited by the need to overcome noise in gene expression.	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb4100070	26
Heterosis as a consequence of regulatory incompatibility	2017.0	['Rebecca H Herbst', 'Dana Bar-zvi', 'Sharon Reikhav', 'Ilya Soifer', 'Michal Breker', 'Ghil Jona', 'Eyal Shimoni', 'Maya Schuldiner', 'Avraham A Levy', 'Naama Barkai']	Bmc biology	The merging of genomes in inter-specific hybrids can result in novel phenotypes, including increased growth rate and biomass yield, a phenomenon known as heterosis. Heterosis is typically viewed as the opposite of hybrid incompatibility. In this view, the superior performance of the hybrid is attributed to heterozygote combinations that compensate for deleterious mutations accumulating in each individual genome, or lead to new, over-dominating interactions with improved performance. Still, only fragmented knowledge is available on genes and processes contributing to heterosis. We describe a budding yeast hybrid that grows faster than both its parents under different environments. Phenotypically, the hybrid progresses more rapidly through cell cycle checkpoints, relieves the repression of respiration in fast growing conditions, does not slow down its growth when presented with ethanol stress, and shows …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-017-0373-7	25
A WntD-Dependent Integral Feedback Loop Attenuates Variability in Drosophila Toll Signaling	2016.0	['Neta Rahimi', 'Inna Averbukh', 'Michal Haskel-ittah', 'Neta Degani', 'Eyal D Schejter', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']	Developmental cell	Patterning by morphogen gradients relies on the capacity to generate reproducible distribution profiles. Morphogen spread depends on kinetic parameters, including diffusion and degradation rates, which vary between embryos, raising the question of how variability is controlled. We examined this in the context of Toll-dependent dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo. We find that low embryo-to-embryo variability in DV patterning relies on wntD, a Toll-target gene expressed initially at the posterior pole. WntD protein is secreted and disperses in the extracellular milieu, associates with its receptor Frizzled4, and inhibits the Toll pathway by blocking the Toll extracellular domain. Mathematical modeling predicts that WntD accumulates until the Toll gradient narrows to its desired spread, and we support this feedback experimentally. This circuit exemplifies a broadly applicable induction-contraction …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580716300016	25
Nucleosome organization affects the sensitivity of gene expression to promoter mutations	2012.0	['Gil Hornung', 'Moshe Oren', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular cell	Gene expression diverges rapidly between related species, playing a key role in the evolution of new phenotypes. The extent of divergence differs greatly between genes and is correlated to promoter nucleosome organization. We hypothesized that this may be partially explained by differential sensitivity of expression to mutations in the promoter region. We measured the sensitivity of 22 yeast promoters with varying nucleosome patterns to random mutations in sequence. Mutation sensitivity differed by up to 10-fold between promoters. This difference could not be explained by the abundance of transcription factor binding sites. Rather, mutation sensitivity positively correlated with the relative occupancy of nucleosomes at the proximal promoter region. Furthermore, mutation sensitivity was reduced upon introduction of a binding site for Reb1, a factor that blocks nucleosome formation, suggesting that nucleosome …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276512001785	24
Disentangling signaling gradients generated by equivalent sources	2012.0	['Noa Rappaport', 'Naama Barkai']	Journal of biological physics	Yeast cells approach a mating partner by polarizing along a gradient of mating pheromones that are secreted by cells of the opposite mating type. The Bar1 protease is secreted by a-cells and, paradoxically, degrades the α-factor pheromones which are produced by cells of the opposite mating type and trigger mating in a-cells. This degradation may assist in the recovery from pheromone signaling but has also been shown to play a positive role in mating. Previous studies suggested that widely diffusing protease can bias the pheromone gradient towards the closest secreting cell. Here, we show that restricting the Bar1 protease to the secreting cell itself, preventing its wide diffusion, facilitates discrimination between equivalent mating partners. This may be mostly relevant during spore germination, where most mating events occur in nature.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10867-011-9240-x	24
Periodic patterning of the Drosophila eye is stabilized by the diffusible activator Scabrous	2016.0	['Avishai Gavish', 'Arkadi Shwartz', 'Abraham Weizman', 'Eyal Schejter', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature communications	Generation of periodic patterns is fundamental to the differentiation of multiple tissues during development. How such patterns form robustly is still unclear. The Drosophila eye comprises∼ 750 units, whose crystalline order is set during differentiation of the eye imaginal disc: an activation wave sweeping across the disc is coupled to lateral inhibition, sequentially selecting pro-neural cells. Using mathematical modelling, here we show that this template-based lateral inhibition is highly sensitive to spatial variations in biochemical parameters and cell sizes. We reveal the basis of this sensitivity, and suggest that it can be overcome by assuming a short-range diffusible activator. Clonal experiments identify Scabrous, a previously implicated inhibitor, as the predicted activator. Our results reveal the mechanism by which periodic patterning in the fly eye is stabilized against spatial variations, highlighting how the need to …	https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10461	23
Epigenetic control of expression homeostasis during replication is stabilized by the replication checkpoint	2018.0	['Yoav Voichek', 'Karin Mittelman', 'Yulia Gordon', 'Raz Bar-ziv', 'David Lifshitz Smit', 'Rom Shenhav', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular cell	DNA replication introduces a dosage imbalance between early and late replicating genes. In budding yeast, buffering gene expression against this imbalance depends on marking replicated DNA by H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac). Whether additional processes are required for suppressing transcription from H3K56ac-labeled DNA remains unknown. Here, using a database-guided candidate screen, we find that COMPASS, the H3K4 methyltransferase, and its upstream effector, PAF1C, act downstream of H3K56ac to buffer expression. Replicated genes show reduced abundance of the transcription activating mark H3K4me3 and accumulate the transcription inhibitory mark H3K4me2 near transcription start sites. Notably, in hydroxyurea-exposed cells, the S phase checkpoint stabilizes H3K56ac and becomes essential for buffering. We suggest that H3K56ac suppresses transcription of replicated genes by interfering …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276518303897	22
Increasing population growth by asymmetric segregation of a limiting resource during cell division	2013.0	['Nurit Avraham', 'Ilya Soifer', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	We report that when budding yeast are transferred to low‐metal environment, they adopt a proliferation pattern in which division is restricted to the subpopulation of mother cells which were born in rich conditions, before the shift. Mother cells continue to divide multiple times following the shift, generating at each division a single daughter cell, which arrests in G1. The transition to a mother‐restricted proliferation pattern is characterized by asymmetric segregation of the vacuole to the mother cell and requires the transcription repressor Whi5. Notably, while deletion of WHI5 alleviates daughter cell division arrest in low‐zinc conditions, it results in a lower final population size, as cell division rate becomes progressively slower. Our data suggest a new stress‐response strategy, in which the dilution of a limiting cellular resource is prevented by maintaining it within a subset of dividing cells, thereby increasing population …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb.2013.13	22
Sequential feedback induction stabilizes the phosphate starvation response in budding yeast	2014.0	['Noam Vardi', 'Sagi Levy', 'Yonat Gurvich', 'Tamar Polacheck', 'Miri Carmi', 'Diego Jaitin', 'Ido Amit', 'Naama Barkai']	Cell reports	Depletion of essential nutrients triggers regulatory programs that prolong cell growth and survival. Starvation-induced processes increase nutrient transport, mobilize nutrient storage, and recycle nutrients between cellular components. This leads to an effective increase in intracellular nutrients, which may act as a negative feedback that downregulates the starvation program. To examine how cells overcome this potential instability, we followed the transcription response of budding yeast transferred to medium lacking phosphate. Genes were induced in two temporal waves. The first wave was stably maintained and persisted even upon phosphate replenishment, indicating a positive feedback loop. This commitment was abolished after 2 hr with the induction of the second expression wave, coinciding with the reduction in cell growth rate. We show that the overall temporal stability of the expression response depends …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124714008420	21
Coordination of gene expression and growth-rate in natural populations of budding yeast	2014.0	['Zvi Tamari', 'Dalia Rosin', 'Yoav Voichek', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos one	Cells adapt to environmental changes through genetic mutations that stabilize novel phenotypes. Often, this adaptation involves regulatory changes which modulate gene expression. In the budding yeast, ribosomal-related gene expression correlates with cell growth rate across different environments. To examine whether the same relationship between gene expression and growth rate is observed also across natural populations, we measured gene expression, growth rate and ethanol production of twenty-four wild type yeast strains originating from diverse habitats, grown on the pentose sugar xylulose. We found that expression of ribosome-related genes did not correlate with growth rate. Rather, growth rate was correlated with the expression of amino acid biosynthesis genes. Searching other databases, we observed a similar correlation between growth rate and amino-acid biosyntehsis genes in a library of gene deletions. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding how cells coordinate their translation capacity with available nutrient resources.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088801	19
Loss of growth homeostasis by genetic decoupling of cell division from biomass growth: implication for size control mechanisms	2014.0	['Hannah Schmidt‐glenewinkel', 'Naama Barkai']	Molecular systems biology	Growing cells adjust their division time with biomass accumulation to maintain growth homeostasis. Size control mechanisms, such as the size checkpoint, provide an inherent coupling of growth and division by gating certain cell cycle transitions based on cell size. We describe genetic manipulations that decouple cell division from cell size, leading to the loss of growth homeostasis, with cells becoming progressively smaller or progressively larger until arresting. This was achieved by modulating glucose influx independently of external glucose. Division rate followed glucose influx, while volume growth was largely defined by external glucose. Therefore, the coordination of size and division observed in wild‐type cells reflects tuning of two parallel processes, which is only refined by an inherent feedback‐dependent coupling. We present a class of size control models explaining the observed breakdowns of growth …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/msb.20145513	18
Interpreting clone-mediated perturbations of morphogen profiles	2005.0	['Avigdor Eldar', 'Naama Barkai']		Generating clones of mutated cells within a wild-type tissue is a powerful experimental paradigm for elucidating gene function. Recently, this approach was employed for identifying genes that shape morphogen profiles in the Drosophila wing-imaginal disc. Interpreting such experiments poses a theoretical challenge. We present a general framework that links specific features of the morphogen profile in the clone vicinity to three basic morphogen properties: diffusion, degradation, and binding to immobile elements. Our results provide rigorous criteria to examine existing data and can facilitate the design and interpretation of future clone experiments.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604007845	18
Modeling pattern formation: counting to two in the Drosophila egg	2002.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']		The EGF receptor pathway patterns the Drosophila egg and specifies the position of its dorsal appendages.

United we sense ⃛	1998.0	['N Barkai', 'S Leibler']	Nature	8 direction of motion is chosen. To achieve chemotaxis, a bacterium that is moving in a favourable direction along a chemical gradient suppresses tumbling events, and thus migrates, on average, towards attractant and away from repellent. Although tumbling frequency is modulated by changes in chemical concentrations, its steady-state value is independent of the concentration itself. This property is called exact adaptation. Among other effects, it is believed that adaptation allows bacteria to respond to gradients over a wide range of background chemical levels. The biochemical network that mediates the chemotactic response is relatively simple8. Sensory receptors modulate the activity of an associated kinase that phosphorylates a messenger protein, which, by interacting with flagellar motors, induces tumbling (Fig. 1). Binding of an attractant, such as aspartate, to the receptor suppresses tumbling by inhibiting the …	https://www.nature.com/articles/29881	15
Dealing with gene-dosage imbalance during S phase	2016.0	['Raz Bar-ziv', 'Yoav Voichek', 'Naama Barkai']		DNA replication perturbs the dosage balance between genes that replicate early during S phase and those that replicate late. If propagated to influence protein content, this dosage imbalance could influence cellular functions. In bacteria, mechanisms have evolved to use this imbalance to tune certain processes with the rate of cell growth. By contrast, eukaryotes buffer this dosage imbalance to ensure gene expression homeostasis also during S phase. Here, we outline classical and more recent studies describing how different organisms deal with this replication-dependent dosage imbalance, and describe recent results linking the eukaryotic buffering mechanism to replication-dependent histone acetylation. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of this buffering mechanism and speculate why it is specific to eukaryote cells.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952516300981	14
Improved readout precision of the Bicoid morphogen gradient by early decoding	2012.0	['Zvi Tamari', 'Naama Barkai']	Journal of biological physics	Transcription factors (TFs) bind to specific DNA sequences to induce or repress gene expression. Expression levels can be tuned by changing TF concentrations, but the precision of such tuning is limited, since the fraction of time a TF occupies its binding site is subject to stochastic fluctuations. Bicoid (Bcd) is a TF that patterns the early Drosophila embryo by establishing an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient and activating specific gene targets (“gap genes”) in a concentration-dependent manner. Recently, the Bcd gradient and its in-vivo diffusion were quantified in live embryos, raising a quandary: the precision by which the Bcd target genes are defined (one-cell resolution) appeared to exceed the physical limits set by the stochastic binding of Bcd to DNA. We hypothesize that early readout of Bcd could account for the observed precision. Specifically, we consider the possibility that gap genes …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10867-011-9250-8	14
Promoter nucleosome organization shapes the evolution of gene expression	2012.0	['Dalia Rosin', 'Gil Hornung', 'Itay Tirosh', 'Ariel Gispan', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos genetics	Understanding why genes evolve at different rates is fundamental to evolutionary thinking. In species of the budding yeast, the rate at which genes diverge in expression correlates with the organization of their promoter nucleosomes: genes lacking a nucleosome-free region (denoted OPN for “Occupied Proximal Nucleosomes”) vary widely between the species, while the expression of those containing NFR (denoted DPN for “Depleted Proximal Nucleosomes”) remains largely conserved. To examine if early evolutionary dynamics contributes to this difference in divergence, we artificially selected for high expression of GFP–fused proteins. Surprisingly, selection was equally successful for OPN and DPN genes, with ∼80% of genes in each group stably increasing in expression by a similar amount. Notably, the two groups adapted by distinct mechanisms: DPN–selected strains duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN–selected strains favored trans mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN (but not OPN) genes reverted rapidly to wild-type expression levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species. Our results suggest that promoter organization constrains the early evolutionary dynamics and in this way biases the path of long-term evolution.	https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002579	13
The ups and downs of biological timers	2005.0	['Noa Rappaport', 'Shay Winter', 'Naama Barkai']	Theoretical biology and medical modelling	The need to execute a sequence of events in an orderly and timely manner is central to many biological processes, including cell cycle progression and cell differentiation. For self-perpetuating systems, such as the cell cycle oscillator, delay times between events are defined by the network of interacting proteins that propagates the system. However, protein levels inside cells are subject to genetic and environmental fluctuations, raising the question of how reliable timing is maintained. We compared the robustness of different mechanisms for encoding delay times to fluctuations in protein expression levels. Gradual accumulation and gradual decay of a regulatory protein have an equivalent capacity for defining delay times. Yet, we find that the former is highly sensitive to fluctuations in gene dosage, while the latter can buffer such perturbations. In particular, a positive feedback where the degrading protein auto-enhances its own degradation may render delay times practically insensitive to gene dosage. While our understanding of biological timing mechanisms is still rudimentary, it is clear that there is an ample use of degradation as well as self-enhanced degradation in processes such as cell cycle and circadian clocks. We propose that degradation processes, and specifically self-enhanced degradation, will be preferred in processes where maintaining the robustness of timing is important.	https://tbiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4682-2-22	13
Dual role of starvation signaling in promoting growth and recovery	2017.0	['Yonat Gurvich', 'Dena Leshkowitz', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos biology	Growing cells are subject to cycles of nutrient depletion and repletion. A shortage of nutrients activates a starvation program that promotes growth in limiting conditions. To examine whether nutrient-deprived cells prepare also for their subsequent recovery, we followed the transcription program activated in budding yeast transferred to low-phosphate media and defined its contribution to cell growth during phosphate limitation and upon recovery. An initial transcription wave was induced by moderate phosphate depletion that did not affect cell growth. A second transcription wave followed when phosphate became growth limiting. The starvation program contributed to growth only in the second, growth-limiting phase. Notably, the early response, activated at moderate depletion, promoted recovery from starvation by increasing phosphate influx upon transfer to rich medium. Our results suggest that cells subject to nutrient depletion prepare not only for growth in the limiting conditions but also for their predicted recovery once nutrients are replenished.	https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002039	12

Dynamics of Spaetzle morphogen shuttling in the Drosophila embryo shapes gastrulation patterning	2019.0	['Neta Rahimi', 'Inna Averbukh', 'Shari Carmon', 'Eyal D Schejter', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']	Development	Establishment of morphogen gradients in the early Drosophila embryo is challenged by a diffusible extracellular milieu, and by rapid nuclear divisions that occur at the same time. To understand how a sharp gradient is formed within this dynamic environment, we followed the generation of graded nuclear Dorsal protein, the hallmark of pattern formation along the dorso-ventral axis, in live embryos. The dynamics indicate that a sharp extracellular gradient is formed through diffusion-based shuttling of the Spaetzle (Spz) morphogen that progresses through several nuclear divisions. Perturbed shuttling in wntD mutant embryos results in a flat activation peak and aberrant gastrulation. Re-entry of Dorsal into the nuclei at the final division cycle plays an instructive role, as the residence time of Dorsal in each nucleus is translated to the amount of zygotic transcript that will be produced, thereby guiding graded …	https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article-abstract/146/21/dev181487/223181	11
Checkpoint-independent scaling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeDNA replication program	2014.0	['Ariel Gispan', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Bmc biology	In budding yeast, perturbations that prolong S phase lead to a proportionate delay in the activation times of most origins. The DNA replication checkpoint was implicated in this scaling phenotype, as an intact checkpoint was shown to be required for the delayed activation of late origins in response to hydroxyurea treatment. In support of that, scaling is lost in cells deleted of mrc1, a mediator of the replication checkpoint signal. Mrc1p, however, also plays a role in normal replication. To examine whether the replication checkpoint is required for scaling the replication profile with S phase duration we measured the genome-wide replication profile of different MRC1 alleles that separate its checkpoint function from its role in normal replication, and further analyzed the replication profiles of S phase mutants that are checkpoint deficient. We found that the checkpoint is not required for scaling; rather the unique replication phenotype of mrc1 deleted cells is attributed to the role of Mrc1 in normal replication. This is further supported by the replication profiles of tof1Δ which functions together with Mrc1p in normal replication, and by the distinct replication profiles of specific POL2 alleles which differ in their interaction with Mrc1p. We suggest that the slow fork progression in mrc1 deleted cells reduces the likelihood of passive replication leading to the activation of origins that remain mostly dormant in wild-type cells.	https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-014-0079-z	10
Divergence and selectivity of expression-coupled histone modifications in budding yeasts	2014.0	['Yaron Mosesson', 'Yoav Voichek', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos one	Various histone modifications are widely associated with gene expression, but their functional selectivity at individual genes remains to be characterized. Here, we identify widespread differences between genome-wide patterns of two prominent marks, H3K9ac and H3K4me3, in budding yeasts. As well as characteristic gene profiles, relative modification levels vary significantly amongst genes, irrespective of expression. Interestingly, we show that these differences couple to contrasting features: higher methylation to essential, periodically expressed, ‘DPN’ (Depleted Proximal Nucleosome) genes, and higher acetylation to non-essential, responsive, ‘OPN’ (Occupied Proximal Nucleosome) genes. Thus, H3K4me3 may generally associate with expression stability, and H3K9ac, with variability. To evaluate this notion, we examine their association with expression divergence between the closely related species, S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. Although individually well conserved at orthologous genes, changes between modifications are mostly uncorrelated, indicating largely non-overlapping regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we find that inter-species differences in methylation, but not acetylation, are well correlated with expression changes, thereby proposing H3K4me3 as a candidate regulator of expression divergence. Taken together, our results suggest distinct evolutionary roles for expression-linked modifications, wherein H3K4me3 may contribute to stabilize average expression, whilst H3K9ac associates with more indirect aspects such as responsiveness.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101538	10

Reverse engineering of the spindle assembly checkpoint	2009.0	['Andreas Doncic', 'Eshel Ben-jacob', 'Shmuel Einav', 'Naama Barkai']	Plos one	The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) is an intracellular mechanism that ensures proper chromosome segregation. By inhibiting Cdc20, a co-factor of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), the checkpoint arrests the cell cycle until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Inhibition of Cdc20 is mediated by a conserved network of interacting proteins. The individual functions of these proteins are well characterized, but understanding of their integrated function is still rudimentary. We here describe our attempts to reverse-engineer the SAC network based on gene deletion phenotypes. We begun by formulating a general model of the SAC which enables us to predict the rate of chromosomal missegregation for any putative set of interactions between the SAC proteins. Next the missegregation rates of seven yeast strains are measured in response to the deletion of one or two checkpoint proteins. Finally, we searched for the set of interactions that correctly predicted the observed missegregation rates of all deletion mutants. Remarkably, although based on only seven phenotypes, the consistent network we obtained successfully reproduces many of the known properties of the SAC. Further insights provided by our analysis are discussed.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006495	10
Speed–specificity trade-offs in the transcription factors search for their genomic binding sites	2021.0	['Tamar Jana', 'Sagie Brodsky', 'Naama Barkai']		Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding DNA sequences recognized by their DNA-binding domains (DBDs). DBD-recognized motifs are short and highly abundant in genomes. The ability of TFs to bind a specific subset of motif-containing sites, and to do so rapidly upon activation, is fundamental for gene expression in all eukaryotes. Despite extensive interest, our understanding of the TF-target search process is fragmented; although binding specificity and detection speed are two facets of this same process, trade-offs between them are rarely addressed. In this opinion article, we discuss potential speed–specificity trade-offs in the context of existing models. We further discuss the recently described ‘distributed specificity’ paradigm, suggesting that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) promote specificity while reducing the TF-target search time.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952520303279	9
Uncovering targeting priority to yeast peroxisomes using an in-cell competition assay	2020.0	['Mira Rosenthal', 'Eyal Metzl-raz', 'Jérôme Bürgi', 'Eden Yifrach', 'Layla Drwesh', 'Amir Fadel', 'Yoav Peleg', 'Doron Rapaport', 'Matthias Wilmanns', 'Naama Barkai', 'Maya Schuldiner', 'Einat Zalckvar']	Proceedings of the national academy of sciences	Approximately half of eukaryotic proteins reside in organelles. To reach their correct destination, such proteins harbor targeting signals recognized by dedicated targeting pathways. It has been shown that differences in targeting signals alter the efficiency in which proteins are recognized and targeted. Since multiple proteins compete for any single pathway, such differences can affect the priority for which a protein is catered. However, to date the entire repertoire of proteins with targeting priority, and the mechanisms underlying it, have not been explored for any pathway. Here we developed a systematic tool to study targeting priority and used the Pex5-mediated targeting to yeast peroxisomes as a model. We titrated Pex5 out by expressing high levels of a Pex5-cargo protein and examined how the localization of each peroxisomal protein is affected. We found that while most known Pex5 cargo proteins were …	https://www.pnas.org/content/117/35/21432.short	9
Rapid evolutionary adaptation to growth on an ‘unfamiliar’carbon source	2016.0	['Zvi Tamari', 'Avihu H Yona', 'Yitzhak Pilpel', 'Naama Barkai']	Bmc genomics	Cells constantly adapt to changes in their environment. When environment shifts between conditions that were previously encountered during the course of evolution, evolutionary-programmed responses are possible. Cells, however, may also encounter a new environment to which a novel response is required. To characterize the first steps in adaptation to a novel condition, we studied budding yeast growth on xylulose, a sugar that is very rarely found in the wild. We previously reported that growth on xylulose induces the expression of amino acid biosynthesis genes in multiple natural yeast isolates. This induction occurs despite the presence of amino acids in the growth medium and is a unique response to xylulose, not triggered by naturally available carbon sources. Propagating these strains for ~300 generations on xylulose significantly improved their growth rate. Notably, the most significant change in gene …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-016-3010-x	9
EGF receptor signaling—a quantitative view	2007.0	['Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']	Current biology	Almost a century ago, the experiments of Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold on transplantation of cells between Xenopus embryos demonstrated that the body plan is determined by intricate communication between cells. Today, through genetic, molecular and biochemical analyses, we know the major signaling pathways that mediate these interactions and many of their molecular constituents, which are highly conserved in evolution. Despite mechanistic differences between the pathways, the general mode through which they function is similar. A diffusible signaling molecule—morphogen—is released from a restricted group of cells and spreads to define a concentration gradient. On reaching a responsive neighboring cell, the morphogen triggers an intracellular signaling pathway; the information is ultimately transmitted to the nucleus where it alters the program of gene expression. The receiving cells can …	https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(07)02194-X.pdf	9
Transcription factor binding to replicated DNA	2020.0	['Raz Bar-ziv', 'Sagie Brodsky', 'Michal Chapal', 'Naama Barkai']	Cell reports	Genome replication perturbs the DNA regulatory environment by displacing DNA-bound proteins, replacing nucleosomes, and introducing dosage imbalance between regions replicating at different S-phase stages. Recently, we showed that these effects are integrated to maintain transcription homeostasis: replicated genes increase in dosage, but their expression remains stable due to replication-dependent epigenetic changes that suppress transcription. Here, we examine whether reduced transcription from replicated DNA results from limited accessibility to regulatory factors by measuring the time-resolved binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and specific transcription factors (TFs) to DNA during S phase in budding yeast. We show that the Pol II binding pattern is largely insensitive to DNA dosage, indicating limited binding to replicated DNA. In contrast, binding of three TFs (Reb1, Abf1, and Rap1) to DNA …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720302953	8
Model-based analysis of DNA replication profiles: predicting replication fork velocity and initiation rate by profiling free-cycling cells	2017.0	['Ariel Gispan', 'Miri Carmi', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome research	Eukaryotic cells initiate DNA synthesis by sequential firing of hundreds of origins. This ordered replication is described by replication profiles, which measure the DNA content within a cell population. Here, we show that replication dynamics can be deduced from replication profiles of free-cycling cells. While such profiles lack explicit temporal information, they are sensitive to fork velocity and initiation capacity through the passive replication pattern, namely the replication of origins by forks emanating elsewhere. We apply our model-based approach to a compendium of profiles that include most viable budding yeast mutants implicated in replication. Predicted changes in fork velocity or initiation capacity are verified by profiling synchronously replicating cells. Notably, most mutants implicated in late (or early) origin effects are explained by global modulation of fork velocity or initiation capacity. Our approach provides a …	https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/2/310.short	8
A role for Rtt109 in buffering gene-dosage imbalance during DNA replication	2016.0	['Yoav Voichek', 'Raz Bar-ziv', 'Naama Barkai']		Chromatin can function as an integrator of DNA-related processes, allowing communication, for example, between DNA replication and gene transcription. Such communication is needed to overcome the gene-dosage imbalance introduced during DNA replication, when certain genes are replicated prior to others. Increased transcription of early replicating genes could alter regulatory balances. This does not occur, suggesting a mechanism that suppresses expression from newly replicated DNA. Critical to this buffering is Rtt109, which acetylates the internal K56 residue of newly synthesized histone H3 prior to incorporation onto DNA. H3K56ac distinguishes replicated from non-replicated DNA, communicating this information to the transcription machinery to ensure expression homeostasis during S phase.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19491034.2016.1216743	7
Independent evolution of transcript abundance and gene regulatory dynamics	2020.0	['Gat Krieger', 'Offir Lupo', 'Avraham A Levy', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome research	Changes in gene expression drive novel phenotypes, raising interest in how gene expression evolves. In contrast to the static genome, cells modulate gene expression in response to changing environments. Previous comparative studies focused on specific conditions, describing interspecies variation in expression levels, but providing limited information about variation across different conditions. To close this gap, we profiled mRNA levels of two related yeast species in hundreds of conditions and used coexpression analysis to distinguish variation in the dynamic pattern of gene expression from variation in expression levels. The majority of genes whose expression varied between the species maintained a conserved dynamic pattern. Cases of diverged dynamic pattern correspond to genes that were induced under distinct subsets of conditions in the two species. Profiling the interspecific hybrid allowed us to …	https://genome.cshlp.org/content/30/7/1000.short	6
A visual framework for classifying determinants of cell size	2018.0	['Felix Jonas', 'Ilya Soifer', 'Naama Barkai']	Cell reports	Cells control their size by coordinating cell cycle progression with volume growth. Size control is typically studied at specific cell cycle transitions that are delayed or accelerated depending on size. This focus is well suited for revealing mechanisms acting at these transitions, but neglects the dynamics in other cell cycle phases, and is therefore inherently limited for studying how the characteristic cell size is determined. We address this limitation through a formalism that intuitively visualizes the characteristic size emerging from integrated cell cycle dynamics of individual cells. Applying this formalism to budding yeast, we describe the contributions of the un-budded (G1) and budded (S-G2-M) phase to size adjustments following environmental or genetic perturbations. We show that although the budded phase can be perturbed with little consequences for G1 dynamics, perturbations in G1 propagate to the budded …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718318783	6
The genetic requirements for pentose fermentation in budding yeast	2017.0	['Karin Mittelman', 'Naama Barkai']	G3: genes, genomes, genetics	Cells grow on a wide range of carbon sources by regulating substrate flow through the metabolic network. Incoming sugar, for example, can be fermented or respired, depending on the carbon identity, cell type, or growth conditions. Despite this genetically-encoded flexibility of carbon metabolism, attempts to exogenously manipulate central carbon flux by rational design have proven difficult, suggesting a robust network structure. To examine this robustness, we characterized the ethanol yield of 411 regulatory and metabolic mutants in budding yeast. The mutants showed little variation in ethanol productivity when grown on glucose or galactose, yet diversity was revealed during growth on xylulose, a rare pentose not widely available in nature. While producing ethanol at high yield, cells grown on xylulose produced ethanol at high yields, yet induced expression of respiratory genes, and were dependent on …	https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/7/6/1743/6029820	6
Order through disorder: The role of intrinsically disordered regions in transcription factor binding specificity	2021.0	['Sagie Brodsky', 'Tamar Jana', 'Naama Barkai']		Transcription factors (TFs) must bind at specific genomic locations to accurately regulate gene expression. The ability of TFs to recognize specific DNA sequence motifs arises from the inherent preferences of their globular DNA-binding domains (DBDs). Yet, these preferences are insufficient to explain the in vivo TF binding site selection. TFs are enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), most of which are poorly characterized. While not generally considered as determinants of TF binding specificity, IDRs guide protein–protein interactions within transcriptional condensates, and multiple examples exist in which short IDRs flanking the DBD contribute to binding specificity via direct contact with the DNA. We recently reported that long IDRs, present away from the DBD, act as major specificity determinants at the genomic scale. Here, we discuss mechanisms through which IDRs contribute to DNA binding …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X21000956	5
Gene transcription as a limiting factor in protein production and cell growth	2020.0	['Eyal Metzl-raz', 'Moshe Kafri', 'Gilad Yaakov', 'Naama Barkai']	G3: genes, genomes, genetics	Cell growth is driven by the synthesis of proteins, genes, and other cellular components. Defining processes that limit biosynthesis rates is fundamental for understanding the determinants of cell physiology. Here, we analyze the consequences of engineering cells to express extremely high levels of mCherry proteins, as a tool to define limiting processes that fail to adapt upon increasing biosynthetic demands. Protein-burdened cells were transcriptionally and phenotypically similar to mutants of the Mediator, a transcription coactivator complex. However, our binding data suggest that the Mediator was not depleted from endogenous promoters. Burdened cells showed an overall increase in the abundance of the majority of endogenous transcripts, except for highly expressed genes. Our results, supported by mathematical modeling, suggest that wild-type cells transcribe highly expressed genes at the maximal …	https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/10/9/3229/6060149	5
Dealing with noise: The challenge of buffering biological variability	2017.0	['Inna Averbukh', 'Avishai Gavish', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Naama Barkai']		Cells process information using bio-molecular circuits of interacting proteins and genes. A remarkable property of these circuits is their ability to function in highly variable biological environments: Biochemical processes are stochastic, environmental conditions fluctuate, and genetic polymorphisms are abundant. How is variability buffered to maintain a robust output? Can variability be exploited to allow computations not possible by deterministic dynamics? These questions lie at the heart of contemporary systems biology. We argue here that biological variability is fundamental for understanding principles underlying design and function of biological circuits. As concrete examples, we will discuss the buffering of variability during embryonic patterning, and the incorporation of variability in microbial responses to changing conditions.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452310016300312	5
A two-step patterning process increases the robustness of periodic patterning in the fly eye	2016.0	['Avishai Gavish', 'Naama Barkai']	Journal of biological physics	Complex periodic patterns can self-organize through dynamic interactions between diffusible activators and inhibitors. In the biological context, self-organized patterning is challenged by spatial heterogeneities (‘noise’) inherent to biological systems. How spatial variability impacts the periodic patterning mechanism and how it can be buffered to ensure precise patterning is not well understood. We examine the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the periodic patterning of the fruit fly eye, an organ composed of ∼800 miniature eye units (ommatidia) whose periodic arrangement along a hexagonal lattice self-organizes during early stages of fly development. The patterning follows a two-step process, with an initial formation of evenly spaced clusters of ∼10 cells followed by a subsequent refinement of each cluster into a single selected cell. Using a probabilistic approach, we calculate the rate of patterning errors …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10867-016-9409-4	5
Natural diversity in pentose fermentation is explained by variations in histone deacetylases	2016.0	['Zvi Tamari', 'Naama Barkai']	Cell reports	The extent to which carbon flux is directed toward fermentation versus respiration differs between cell types and environmental conditions. Understanding the basic cellular processes governing carbon flux is challenged by the complexity of the metabolic and regulatory networks. To reveal the genetic basis for natural diversity in channeling carbon flux, we applied quantitative trait loci analysis by phenotyping and genotyping hundreds of individual F2 segregants of budding yeast that differ in their capacity to ferment the pentose sugar xylulose. Causal alleles were mapped to the RXT3 and PHO23 genes, two components of the large Rpd3 histone deacetylation complex. We show that these allelic variants modulate the expression of SNF1/AMPK-dependent respiratory genes. Our results suggest that over close evolutionary distances, diversification of carbon flow is driven by changes in global regulators, rather than …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124715014898	4
Asymptotic cellular growth rate as the effective information utilization rate	2013.0	['Rami Pugatch', 'Naama Barkai', 'Tsvi Tlusty']	Arxiv preprint arxiv:1308.0623	"We study the average asymptotic growth rate of cells in randomly fluctuating environments, with multiple viable phenotypes per environment. We show that any information processing strategy has an asymptotic growth rate, which is the sum of: (i) the maximal growth rate at the worst possible distribution of environments, (ii) relative information between the actual distribution of environments to the worst one, and (iii) information utilization rate, which is the information rate of the sensory devices minus the ""information dissipation rate"", the amount of information not utilized by the cell for growth. In non-stationary environments, we find that the optimal phenotypic switching times equally partition the information dissipation rate between consecutive switching intervals."	https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0623	4
Physical aspects of precision in genetic regulation	2011.0	['Zvi Tamari', 'Naama Barkai', 'Itzhak Fouxon']	Journal of biological physics	The process by which transcription factors (TFs) locate specific DNA binding sites is stochastic and as such, is subject to a considerable level of noise. TFs diffuse in the three-dimensional nuclear space, but can also slide along the DNA. It was proposed that this sliding facilitates the TF molecules arriving to their binding site, by effectively reducing the dimensionality of diffusion. However, the possible implications of DNA sliding on the accuracy by which the nuclear concentration of TFs can be estimated were not examined. Here, we calculate the mean and the variance of the number of TFs that bind to their binding site in reduced and partially reduced diffusion dimensionality regimes. We find that a search process which combines three-dimensional diffusion in the nucleus with one-dimensional sliding along the DNA can reduce the noise in TF binding and in this way enables a better estimation of the TF …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10867-010-9208-2	4
""" Recurrent signature"" identifies transcriptional modules"	2004.0	['Jan Ihmels', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Naama Barkai']		A method for analyzing and identifying functional linkages between biological processes which are regulated in a coordinate manner. An especially preferred example of a biological process to which the method of the present invention may be applied is the analysis of groups of coordinately regulated genes. More preferably, the present invention analyzes large set of genome-wide expression data or transcriptional data in order to discover coordinately regulated genes, which can be termed “transcriptional modules”. Optionally and most preferably, the groups of genes are identified with their corresponding cis-regulatory elements. Thus, if the cis-regulatory elements for the transcriptional module are not known, they can optionally be identified with the method of the present invention, for example if functional linkages between genes are known and the associated cis-regulatory element is also available, this …	https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040158407A1/en	4
Yeast hybrids and polyploids as models in evolutionary studies	2013.0	['Avraham A Levy', 'Itay Tirosh', 'Sharon Reikhav', 'Yasmin Bloch', 'Naama Barkai']	Polyploid and hybrid genomics	In this chapter, we focus on budding yeasts, a group of related species, with fully sequenced genomes. Haploids and diploids from these species can propagate asexually or mate to produce hybrids and polyploids. There are no zygotic barriers among budding yeasts. Thus, interspecific hybrids and polyploid yeasts are widespread in nature or in domesticated strains used for the making of wine, beer, cider, biofuel, and bread. This, together with all the advantages of being fast‐growing unicellular organisms, makes yeasts ideally suited for contributing to the understanding of evolution in hybrids and polyploids. We describe the insights gained from the analysis of the ancient whole‐genome duplication that occurred in yeast approximately 100 million years ago. Namely, we summarize lessons from the nonrandom retention of duplicated loci in the context of sub‐ and neofunctionalization of genes and of networks of …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118552872.ch1	3
Segmentation within scale	2013.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']	Nature	NAAMA BARKAI & BEN-ZION SHILO Developing organisms face a major challenge: their body pattern must be adjusted—scaled—to their body size. But how is tissue size ‘measured’? And what conveys general size information to the local settings of each cell? Despite intense interest, the mechanistic basis of scaling is poorly understood. On page 101 of this issue, Lauschke et al. 1 report that scaling persists in a tissue-culture model that simulates early segmentation in the vertebrate embryo. The simple, two-dimensional geometry of this system, and the fact that it can be visualized in real time and manipulated, opens exciting avenues for studying the formation and scaling of vertebrate segmentation*. The segmented organization of vertebrates is set up in the early embryo. As the embryo elongates along an anterior–posterior axis, segmented structures called somites bud regularly from the anterior end of its …	https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11849	3
Measurement of histone replacement dynamics with genetically encoded exchange timers in yeast	2021.0	['Gilad Yaakov', 'Felix Jonas', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature biotechnology	Histone exchange between histones carrying position-specific marks and histones bearing general marks is important for gene regulation, but understanding of histone exchange remains incomplete. To overcome the poor time resolution of conventional pulse–chase histone labeling, we present a genetically encoded histone exchange timer sensitive to the duration that two tagged histone subunits co-reside at an individual genomic locus. We apply these sensors to map genome-wide patterns of histone exchange in yeast using single samples. Comparing H3 exchange in cycling and G1-arrested cells suggests that replication-independent H3 exchange occurs at several hundred nucleosomes (< 1% of all nucleosomes) per minute, with a maximal rate at histone promoters. We observed substantial differences between the two nucleosome core subcomplexes: H2A-H2B subcomplexes undergo rapid transcription …	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00959-8	2
Rtt109 slows replication speed by histone N-terminal acetylation	2021.0	['Nelly Frenkel', 'Felix Jonas', 'Miri Carmi', 'Gilad Yaakov', 'Naama Barkai']	Genome research	The wrapping of DNA around histone octamers challenges processes that use DNA as their template. In vitro, DNA replication through chromatin depends on histone modifiers, raising the possibility that cells modify histones to optimize fork progression. Rtt109 is an acetyl transferase that acetylates histone H3 before its DNA incorporation on the K56 and N-terminal residues. We previously reported that, in budding yeast, a wave of histone H3 K9 acetylation progresses ∼3–5 kb ahead of the replication fork. Whether this wave contributes to replication dynamics remained unknown. Here, we show that the replication fork velocity increases following deletion of RTT109, the gene encoding the enzyme required for the prereplication H3 acetylation wave. By using histone H3 mutants, we find that Rtt109-dependent N-terminal acetylation regulates fork velocity, whereas K56 acetylation contributes to replication dynamics …	https://genome.cshlp.org/content/31/3/426.short	2
Accumulation of cis- and trans-regulatory variations is associated with phenotypic divergence of a complex trait between yeast species	2021.0	['Offir Lupo', 'Gat Krieger', 'Felix Jonas', 'Naama Barkai']	G3	Gene regulatory variations accumulate during evolution and alter gene expression. While the importance of expression variation in phenotypic evolution is well established, the molecular basis remains largely unknown. Here, we examine two closely related yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus, which show phenotypical differences in morphology and cell cycle progression when grown in the same environment. By profiling the cell cycle transcriptome and binding of key transcription factors (TFs) in the two species and their hybrid, we show that changes in expression levels and dynamics of oscillating genes are dominated by upstream trans-variations. We find that multiple cell cycle regulators show both cis- and trans-regulatory variations, which alters their expression in favor of the different cell cycle phenotypes. Moreover, we show that variations in the cell cycle TFs, Fkh1 …	https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/11/2/jkab016/6121923	2
Global shape of Toll activation is determined by wntD enhancer properties	2020.0	['Neta Rahimi', 'Shari Carmon', 'Inna Averbukh', 'Farzaneh Khajouei', 'Saurabh Sinha', 'Eyal D Schejter', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ben-zion Shilo']	Proceedings of the national academy of sciences	Buffering variability in morphogen distribution is essential for reproducible patterning. A theoretically proposed class of mechanisms, termed “distal pinning,” achieves robustness by combining local sensing of morphogen levels with global modulation of gradient spread. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for morphogen sensing by a gene enhancer, which ultimately determines the final global distribution of the morphogen and enables reproducible patterning. Specifically, we show that, while the pattern of Toll activation in the early Drosophila embryo is robust to gene dosage of its locally produced regulator, WntD, it is sensitive to a single-nucleotide change in the wntD enhancer. Thus, enhancer properties of locally produced WntD directly impinge on the global morphogen profile.	https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1552.short	2
A transcriptome-wide analysis deciphers distinct roles of G1 cyclins in temporal organization of the yeast cell cycle	2019.0	['Lotte Teufel', 'Katja Tummler', 'Max Flöttmann', 'Andreas Herrmann', 'Naama Barkai', 'Edda Klipp']	Scientific reports	Oscillating gene expression is crucial for correct timing and progression through cell cycle. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G1 cyclins Cln1–3 are essential drivers of the cell cycle and have an important role for temporal fine-tuning. We measured time-resolved transcriptome-wide gene expression for wild type and cyclin single and double knockouts over cell cycle with and without osmotic stress. Clustering of expression profiles, peak time detection of oscillating genes, integration with transcription factor network dynamics, and assignment to cell cycle phases allowed us to quantify the effect of genetic or stress perturbations on the duration of cell cycle phases. Cln1 and Cln2 showed functional differences, especially affecting later phases. Deletion of Cln3 led to a delay of START followed by normal progression through later phases. Our data and network analysis suggest mutual effects of cyclins with the …	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39850-7	2
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spore Germination	2010.0	['Cecilia Geijer', 'Daphna Joseph-strauss', 'Giora Simchen', 'Naama Barkai', 'Stefan Hohmann']		 Saccharomyces cerevisiae spore germination is the process in which dormant spores resume growth. Upon exposure to glucose and other essential nutrients, the spore gradually loses its spore characteristics and starts acquiring properties of a vegetative cell. Translation and transcription are initiated early in the germination process. Global gene expression analysis has revealed that germination can be divided into two stages prior to the first cell cycle. During the first stage, the transcriptional programme resembles the general response of yeast cells to glucose. During the second stage, the spores sense and respond also to other nutrients than glucose. In addition, genes involved in conjugation are upregulated in germinating spores and mating is initiated before the first mitotic cell cycle. Here, we review the current understanding of the cellular rearrangements and the genes and proteins involved …	https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12422-8_3	2

Computer simulation of biomolecular processes using stochastic process algebra	2000.0	['Aviv Regev', 'William Silverman', 'Naama Barkai', 'Ehud Shapiro']	Poster at 8th international conference on intelligent systems for molecular biology, ismb	Computational analysis of sequence and structure information has proved to be extremely successful. The existence of a formal, unifying language to describe the relevant data has played a major role in these advancements. Recently, much interest is focused on system level studies of networks of interacting proteins. These biochemical processes mediate the interaction of cells with their environment and are responsible for most of the information processing inside the cell. Currently, however, there is no formal language to describe such processes. They are analyzed either by simulating the continuous, mass-action di erential equations, or by various discrete, Monte-Carlo simulations.In previous work (1) we have suggested a novel formal non-deterministic and discrete way for modeling biochemical networks using the-calculus.-Calculus (2) is a process algebra, originally used in the study of distributed computer systems. Our-calculus model for biochemical processes is mathematically well-de ned, while remaining biologically faithful and transparent. Our model is amenable to computer simulation, analysis and formal veri cation using a combination of existing and self-developed tools (Logix/FCP, 3). In addition to studying particular systems, it also provides a platform for formalizing higher-level questions regarding modularity, abstraction and comparison of biochemical processes.	http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~biospi/abstract00.ps	2
A regulatory phosphorylation site on Mec1 controls chromatin occupancy of RNA polymerases during replication stress	2021.0	['Verena Hurst', 'Kiran Challa', 'Felix Jonas', 'Romain Forey', 'Ragna Sack', 'Jan Seebacher', 'Christoph D Schmid', 'Naama Barkai', 'Kenji Shimada', 'Susan M Gasser', 'Jérôme Poli']	The embo journal	Upon replication stress, budding yeast checkpoint kinase Mec1ATR triggers the downregulation of transcription, thereby reducing the level of RNA polymerase (RNAP) on chromatin to facilitate replication fork progression. Here, we identify a hydroxyurea‐induced phosphorylation site on Mec1, Mec1‐S1991, that contributes to the eviction of RNAPII and RNAPIII during replication stress. The expression of the non‐phosphorylatable mec1‐S1991A mutant reduces replication fork progression genome‐wide and compromises survival on hydroxyurea. This defect can be suppressed by destabilizing chromatin‐bound RNAPII through a TAP fusion to its Rpb3 subunit, suggesting that lethality in mec1‐S1991A mutants arises from replication–transcription conflicts. Coincident with a failure to repress gene expression on hydroxyurea in mec1‐S1991A cells, highly transcribed genes such as GAL1 remain bound at nuclear …	https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embj.2021108439	1

Mapping the architecture of regulatory variation provides insights into the evolution of complex traits	2020.0	['Offir Lupo', 'Gat Krieger', 'Felix Jonas', 'Naama Barkai']	Biorxiv	Organisms evolve complex traits by recruiting existing programs to new contexts, referred as co-option. Within a species, single upstream regulators can trigger full differentiation programs. Distinguishing whether co-option of differentiation programs results from variation in single regulator, or in multiple genes, is key for understanding how complex traits evolve. As an experimentally accessible model for studying this question we turned to budding yeast, where a differentiation program (filamentous) is activated in S. cerevisiae only upon starvation, but used by the related species S. paradoxus also in rich conditions.To define expression variations associated with species-specific activation of the filamentous program, we profiled the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus and their hybrid along two cell cycles at 5-minutes resolution. As expected in cases of co-option, expression of oscillating genes varies between the species in synchrony with their growth phenotypes and was dominated by upstream trans-variations. Focusing on regulators of filamentous growth, we identified gene-linked variations (cis) in multiple genes across regulatory layers, which propagated to affect expression of target genes, as well as binding specificities of downstream transcription factor. Unexpectedly, variations in regulators essential for S. cerevisiae filamentation were individually too weak to explain activation of this program in S. paradoxus.Our study reveals the complex architecture of regulatory variation associated with species-specific use of a differentiation program. Based on these results, we suggest a new model in which …	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.113217.abstract	1

Pls1 Is a Peroxisomal Matrix Protein with a Role in Regulating Lysine Biosynthesis	2022.0	['Yotam David', 'Inês Gomes Castro', 'Eden Yifrach', 'Chen Bibi', 'Enas Katawi', 'Dekel Yahav Har-shai', 'Sagie Brodsky', 'Naama Barkai', 'Tommer Ravid', 'Miriam Eisenstein', 'Shmuel Pietrokovski', 'Maya Schuldiner', 'Einat Zalckvar']	Cells	Peroxisomes host essential metabolic enzymes and are crucial for human health and survival. Although peroxisomes were first described over 60 years ago, their entire proteome has not yet been identified. As a basis for understanding the variety of peroxisomal functions, we used a high-throughput screen to discover peroxisomal proteins in yeast. To visualize low abundance proteins, we utilized a collection of strains containing a peroxisomal marker in which each protein is expressed from the constitutive and strong TEF2 promoter. Using this approach, we uncovered 18 proteins that were not observed in peroxisomes before and could show their metabolic and targeting factor dependence for peroxisomal localization. We focus on one newly identified and uncharacterized matrix protein, Ynl097c-b, and show that it localizes to peroxisomes upon lysine deprivation and that its localization to peroxisomes depends on the lysine biosynthesis enzyme, Lys1. We demonstrate that Ynl097c-b affects the abundance of Lys1 and the lysine biosynthesis pathway. We have therefore renamed this protein Pls1 for Peroxisomal Lys1 Stabilizing 1. Our work uncovers an additional layer of regulation on the central lysine biosynthesis pathway. More generally it highlights how the discovery of peroxisomal proteins can expand our understanding of cellular metabolism.	https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/9/1426	0
Evolution of binding preferences among whole-genome duplicated transcription factors	2022.0	['Tamar Gera', 'Felix Jonas', 'Roye More', 'Naama Barkai']	Elife	Throughout evolution, new transcription factors (TFs) emerge by gene duplication, promoting growth and rewiring of transcriptional networks. How TF duplicates diverge was studied in a few cases only. To provide a genome-scale view, we considered the set of budding yeast TFs classified as whole-genome duplication (WGD)-retained paralogs (~ 35% of all specific TFs). Using high-resolution profiling, we find that~ 60% of paralogs evolved differential binding preferences. We show that this divergence results primarily from variations outside the DNA-binding domains (DBDs), while DBD preferences remain largely conserved. Analysis of non-WGD orthologs revealed uneven splitting of ancestral preferences between duplicates, and the preferential acquiring of new targets by the least conserved paralog (biased neo/sub-functionalization). Interactions between paralogs were rare, and, when present, occurred through weak competition for DNA-binding or dependency between dimer-forming paralogs. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolutionary design of transcriptional networks.	https://elifesciences.org/articles/73225	0
Rtt109 promotes nucleosome replacement ahead of the replicating fork	2022.0	['Felix Jonas', 'Gilad Yaakov', 'Naama Barkai']	Biorxiv	DNA replication perturbs chromatin by triggering the eviction, replacement and incorporation of nucleosomes. How this dynamic is orchestrated in time and space is poorly understood. Here, we apply a recently established sensor for histone exchange to follow the time-resolved histone H3 exchange profile in budding yeast cells undergoing synchronous replication. We find that new histones are incorporated not only behind, but also ahead of the replication fork. We provide evidence that Rtt109, the S phase-specific acetyltransferase, stabilizes nucleosomes behind the fork, but promotes H3 replacement ahead of the fork. Unexpectedly, increased replacement ahead of the fork is independent of the primary Rtt109 acetylation target H3K56, and rather results from Rtt109 activity towards the H3 N-terminus. Our results suggest that selective incorporation of differentially modified H3s behind and ahead of the replication fork results in opposing effects on histone exchange, which may contribute to genome stability by overcoming replication-associated challenges.	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.479766.abstract	0
Generation and timing of graded responses to morphogen gradients	2021.0	['Shari Carmon', 'Felix Jonas', 'Naama Barkai', 'Eyal D Schejter', 'Ben-zion Shilo']	Development	Morphogen gradients are known to subdivide a naive cell field into distinct zones of gene expression. Here, we examine whether morphogens can also induce a graded response within such domains. To this end, we explore the role of the Dorsal protein nuclear gradient along the dorsoventral axis in defining the graded pattern of actomyosin constriction that initiates gastrulation in early Drosophila embryos. Two complementary mechanisms for graded accumulation of mRNAs of crucial zygotic Dorsal target genes were identified. First, activation of target-gene expression expands over time from the ventral-most region of high nuclear Dorsal to lateral regions, where the levels are lower, as a result of a Dorsal-dependent activation probability of transcription sites. Thus, sites that are activated earlier will exhibit more mRNA accumulation. Second, once the sites are activated, the rate of RNA Polymerase II loading …	https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article-abstract/148/24/dev199991/273784	0

Balancing robustness and evolvability in single cells and beyond	2018.0	['Gilad Yaakov', 'Naama Barkai']		Robustness and evolvability are defining properties of biological systems. Robustness promotes reproducibility of central biological functions, primarily by maintaining low mutation frequency and small mutational effects. By contrast, evolvability is possible only when mutations are frequent enough and lead to selectable functional effects. What is the tradeoff between robustness and evolvability? Here, we explore several cellular strategies used to regulate the balance between robustness and evolvability by modulating mutational impact or frequency. These mechanisms span the gene promoter level, biochemical pathways, single cells and whole organism levels. In particular, we discuss a recently discovered mechanism implemented at the single cell level, in which phenotypic stress-persistence and DNA damage are mechanistically coupled. This coupling increases genetic diversity specifically among individual …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452310017301610	0

Large-scale rewiring in a yeast hybrid	2017.0	['Rebecca H Herbst', 'Dana Bar-zvi', 'Sharon Reikhav', 'Ilya Soifer', 'Michal Breker', 'Ghil Jona', 'Eyal Shimoni', 'Maya Schuldiner', 'Avraham Levy', 'Naama Barkai']	Biorxiv	The merging of genomes in inter-specific hybrids can result in novel phenotypes, including increased growth rate and biomass yield, a phenomenon known as heterosis. We describe a budding yeast hybrid that grows faster than its parents under different environments. Phenotypically, the hybrid progresses more rapidly through cell cycle checkpoints, relieves the repression of respiration in fast growing conditions, does not slow down its growth when presented with ethanol stress, and shows increasing signs of DNA damage. A systematic genetic screen identified hundreds of alleles affecting hybrid growth whose identity vastly differed between the hybrid and its parent and between growth conditions. This large-scale rewiring of allele effects suggests that despite showing clear heterosis, the hybrid is perturbed in multiple regulatory processes. We discuss the possibility that incompatibilities contribute to hybrid vigor by perturbing safeguard mechanisms that limit growth in the parental background.	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/100263.abstract	0

Noa Rappaport	2011.0	['Naama Barkai']		Opportunistic fungal infections frequently afflict immunocompromised patients. The limited number of clinically useful drugs is further restricted by the fact that fungal pathogens exploit a wide range of mechanisms to survive antifungal drugs. Improved knowledge of the molecular pathways potentiating resistance could facilitate the development of novel strategies to combat intransigent infections. Most resistance strategies are characterized by observing either clinical strains or strains produced by experimentally evolving resistance in the lab. Recently, the global effector Hsp90p was shown to be required for the evolution of resistance in S. cerevisiae under specific conditions, suggesting that there may be additional global effectors that facilitate the evolution of resistance.In the first part of this study we examined the evolution of fungal resistance to the widely deployed antimicrobial agent fluconazole.

Sagi Levy	2010.0	['Naama Barkai']		Cells must adjust their gene expression in order to compete in a constantly changing environment. Two alternative strategies could in principle ensure optimal coordination of gene expression with physiological requirements. First, characters of the internal physiological state, such as growth rate or nutrient levels, could feedback to tune gene expression. Second, internal needs could be inferred from the external environment, using feed-forward evolutionary-tuned signaling pathways. In the first part of our study we examined the coordination of gene expression with cellular growth in yeast in order to infer the relative contribution of internal vs. external sensing to the regulation of gene expression. To this end, we subjected S. cerevisiae cells to conditions which decoupled the actual vs. environmentally-expected growth rate. Gene expression followed the environmental signal according to the expected, but not the …	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1358072217349468286&hl=en&oi=scholarr	0
Research Widespread remodeling of mid-coding sequence nucleosomes by Isw1	2010.0	['Itay Tirosh', 'Nadejda Sigal', 'Naama Barkai']		Background: The positions of nucleosomes along eukaryotic DNA are defined by the local DNA sequence and are further tuned by the activity of chromatin remodelers. While the genome-wide effect of most remodelers has not been described, recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that Isw2 prevents ectopic expression of anti-sense and suppressed transcripts at gene ends.Results: We examined the genome-wide function of the Isw2 homologue, Isw1, by mapping nucleosome positioning in S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus strains deleted of ISW1. We found that Isw1 functions primarily within coding regions of genes, consistent with its putative role in transcription elongation. Upon deletion of ISW1, midcoding nucleosomes were shifted upstream (towards the 5'ends) in about half of the genes. Isw1-dependent shifts were correlated with trimethylation of H3K79 and were enriched at genes with internal cryptic initiation sites. Conclusions: Our results suggest a division of labor between Isw1 and Isw2, whereby Isw2 maintains repressive chromatin structure at gene ends while Isw1 has a similar function at mid-coding regions. The differential specificity of the two remodelers may be specified through interactions with particular histone marks.	https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/gb-2010-11-5-r49.pdf	0

Reply to Francois et al.	2009.0	['Danny Ben-zvi', 'Ben-zion Shilo', 'Abraham Fainsod', 'Naama Barkai']	Nature	Metazoan organisms can ‘scale’, that is, maintain similar proportions regardless of size. Ben-Zvi et al. 1 use experiments in Xenopus to support a quantitative model that explains morphological scaling as the result of scaling of a gradient of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals. We believe that the evidence for scaling in Xenopus is misinterpreted, and that their model for embryonic patterning disagrees with prior data. The experiments they present supporting their model admit alternative interpretations.The authors’ model (box 1 of ref. 1) is built around the (BMP inhibitor) Chordin-facilitated transport of two members of the BMP family of ligands, BMP (BMP2/4/7), the total amount of which is preserved, and ADMP, which is produced only in the dorsal organizer but concentrates ventrally and scales along the dorsal–ventral axis at blastula stage. The paper is based on the assumption that dorsal embryonic halves …	https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08306	0

The relative contribution of'internal'vs.'external'sensing to the regulation of gene expression in the budding yeast	2009.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Sagi Levy']	The faseb journal	Cells monitor their external environment using membrane receptors, modulating their gene expression pattern in response to external cues. In addition, cells monitor the level of internal metabolites, energy availability, and growth rate, and these internal characters also feedback to tune gene expression. We examined the relative contribution of internal vs. external sensing to the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis gene expression in yeast. Since cells devote a large fraction of their biosynthetic capacity for ribosomal biogenesis, coordination of ribosomal biogenesis with the requirement for protein synthesis is of particular importance. To distinguish between 'external' and 'internal' sensing, we subjected S. cerevisiae cells to 'confusing' conditions which decoupled the actual vs. environmentally‐expected growth rate.

A general ‘‘Expansion–Repression’’feedback topology will be presented, which ensures scaling for a wide range of parameters and sizes through an effective implementation of an integral-feedback controller.

Robustness of Embryonic Patterning	2002.0	['Naama Barkai']	Aps march meeting abstracts	Developmental patterning proceeds reliably despite natural fluctuations in the expression levels of genes and changes in gene dosage. Patterning mechanisms that rely on morphogen gradients generally involve a network of feedback loops, which buffer against such perturbations. Although most components of the patterning networks have been identified and characterized, quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how their functions are integrated to achieve robustness is still missing. Here, we report a quantitative study of a morphogen gradient, determining cell fates in the fruit-fly embryo. We find that differential protein cleavage, coupled with selective diffusion, defines a robust system which can adjust to large variations in levels of the different protein components. The mechanism underlying robustness relies on the convergence of the signaling profile to a finite distribution, which in most regions is …	https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002APS..MAR.D2002B/abstract	0
Robuste amplification dans les réseaux adaptifs de transduction du signal	2001.0	['Naama Barkai', 'Uri Alon', 'Stanislas Leibler']	Academie des sciences paris comptes rendus serie physique astrophysique	Amplification of small changes in input signals is an essential feature of many biological signal transduction systems. An important problem is how sensitivity amplification can be reconciled with wide dynamic range of response. Here a general molecular mechanism is proposed, in which both high amplification and wide dynamic range of a sensory system is obtained, and this without fine-tuning of biochemical parameters. The amplification mechanism is based on inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the sensory complex. As an example, we show how this' inhibition-driven amplification'mechanism might function in the bacterial chemotaxis network, where it could explain several intriguing experimental observations connected with the existence of high gain, wide dynamic range and robust adaptation.	https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001CRASP...2..871B/abstract	0

The interactions between components are shown in cd.(e): A schematic representation of the inhibition-based mechanism. Patterning is governed by an inhibition gradient established over a field of an activator. The activator may be uniformly distributed. Note that positive feedback of BMP expression may result in graded BMP expression as well, but this is not required for the generation of the gradient itself and does not constitute a main aspect of the patterning mechanism. d, l and v stand for Dorsal, Lateral and Ventral regions of the embryo. Inhibitor in gray, activator in black and the total activator (free and in complex) in dashed black.(f): A schematic representation of the shuttling-based mechanism. Patterning relies on physical translocation of the BMP ligands to the ventral region, leading to an activation gradient that arises primarily from the graded distribution of the BMP ligands themselves.

Bioinformatics Advance Access published March 25, 2004		['Jan Ihmels', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Naama Barkai']		Motivation: Large-scale gene expression data comprising a variety of cellular conditions holds the promise of a global view on the transcription program. While conventional clustering algorithms have been successfully applied to smaller datasets, the utility of many algorithms for the analysis of large-scale data is limited by their inability to capture combinatorial and conditionspecific co-regulation. In addition, there is an increasing need to integrate the rapidly accumulating body of other high-throughput biological data with the expression analysis. In a previous work, we introduced the Signature Algorithm, which overcomes the problems of conventional clustering and allows for intuitive integration of additional biological data. However, the applicability of this approach to global analyses is constrained by the comprehensiveness of relevant external data and by its lacking capability of capturing hierarchical organization of the transcription network.Methods: We present a novel method for the analysis of large-scale expression data, which assigns genes into context-dependent and potentially overlapping regulatory units. We introduce the notion of a transcription module as a self-consistent regulatory unit consisting of a set of coregulated genes as well as the experimental conditions that induce their co-regulation. Selfconsistency is defined by a rigorous mathematical criterion. We propose an efficient algorithm to identify such modules, which is based on the iterative application of the signature algorithm we proposed previously. A threshold parameter that determines the resolution of the modular decomposition is introduced.Results: The method is …	https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.48&rep=rep1&type=pdf	0
Thesis for the degree		['Naama Barkai']		Maintaining nutrient homeostasis is a major challenge to living cells, and important part in this process is monitoring the level of the available nutrients. The cell can use external sensing by using specialized receptors on the cell membrane, which bind the available nutrient or internal sensing by directly monitoring the level of internal nutrients. We realized that such regulation may impair the cells ability to sense environmental changes. How can cells use intracellular sensing but yet maintain the ability to sense environmental changes? Theoretical analysis suggested that a dualtransporters system enables cells to prepare in advance for nutrient depletion. When nutrient abundant the cells use the low affinity transporters until the nutrient outside deplete to the Kd of the low affinity transporters. At this point the relevant starvation response is activated and this activates the expression of the high affinity transporters and …	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11134178450980873013&hl=en&oi=scholarr	0
