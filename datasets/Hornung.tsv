The human raphe nuclei and the serotonergic system	2003.0	['Jean-pierre Hornung']		The raphe nuclei are distributed near the midline of the brainstem along its entire rostro-caudal extension. The serotonergic neurons are their main neuronal components, although a proportion of them lie in subdivisions of the lateral reticular formation. They develop from mesopontine and medullary primordia, and the resulting grouping into rostral and caudal clusters is maintained into adulthood, and is reflected in the connectivity. Thus, the mesencephalon and rostral pons, neurons within the rostral raphe complex (caudal linear, dorsal raphe, and median raphe nuclei) project primarily to the forebrain. By contrast, in the caudal pons and medulla oblongata, neurons within the caudal raphe complex (raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus nuclei and parts of the adjacent lateral reticular formation) project to the brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord. The median raphe and dorsal raphe nuclei provide …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061803001157	852
Cortical 5-HT2A receptor signaling modulates anxiety-like behaviors in mice	2006.0	['Noelia V Weisstaub', 'Mingming Zhou', 'Alena Lira', 'Evelyn Lambe', 'Javier González-maeso', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Etienne Sibille', 'Mark Underwood', 'Shigeyoshi Itohara', 'William T Dauer', 'Mark S Ansorge', 'Emanuela Morelli', 'J John Mann', 'Miklos Toth', 'George Aghajanian', 'Stuart C Sealfon', 'René Hen', 'Jay A Gingrich']	Science	Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] neurotransmission in the central nervous system modulates depression and anxiety-related behaviors in humans and rodents, but the responsible downstream receptors remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that global disruption of 5-HT2A receptor (5HT2AR) signaling in mice reduces inhibition in conflict anxiety paradigms without affecting fear-conditioned and depression-related behaviors. Selective restoration of 5HT2AR signaling to the cortex normalized conflict anxiety behaviors. These findings indicate a specific role for cortical 5HT2AR function in the modulation of conflict anxiety, consistent with models of cortical, “top-down” influences on risk assessment.	https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1123432	496
Patterns of synaptic input to layer 4 of cat striate cortex	1984.0	['Barbara A Mcguire', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Charles D Gilbert', 'Torsten N Wiesel']	Journal of neuroscience	Although cells in layer 4 of cat striate cortex represent the first stage in the cortical processing of visual information, they have considerably more complicated receptive field properties than the afferents to the layer from the lateral geniculate nucleus. In considering how these properties are generated, we have focused on the intrinsic cortical circuitry, and particularly on the projection to layer 4 from layer 6. Layer 6 pyramidal cells were injected with horseradish peroxidase and examined at the light and electron microscopic level. The labeled axon terminals were found to form asymmetric synapses and to show a strong preference for contacting dendritic shafts. Serial reconstruction of dendrites postsynaptic to labeled layer 6 cell axon terminals showed that a large proportion of the postsynaptic dendrites belonged to smooth and sparsely spiny stellate cells, suggesting a selective innervation of these cell types.

Distribution, morphology and number of monoamine-synthesizing and substance P-containing neurons in the human dorsal raphe nucleus	1991.0	['Kg Baker', 'Gm Halliday', 'J-p Hornung', 'Lb Geffen', 'Rgh Cotton']	Neuroscience	The distribution, morphology and number of serotonin-, catecholamine- and substance P-containing neurons in the human dorsal raphe nucleus were studied. Parallel series of sections were prepared from 10 human brainstems obtained at autopsy from palients without neurological disease aged between 42 and 88 years. The neurons were identified using immunohistochemistry with antibodies raised against phenylalanine hydroxylase (tryptophan hydroxylase-containing, serotonin neurons), tyrosine hydroxylase (catecholamine neurons) and substance P.A reference series of Nissl-stained sections was also prepared and data published separately were used to delineate the subnuclear divisions of the dorsal raphe nucleus and to establish the total number of neurons in each subnucleus.The following principal findings emerged.(1)Serotonin-synthesizing neurons are present in all regions of the dorsal raphe …Serotonin-synthesizing neurons are present in all regions of the dorsal raphe …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645229190043N	247
Increased exploratory activity and altered response to LSD in mice lacking the 5-HT5A receptor	1999.0	['Régis Grailhe', 'Christian Waeber', 'Stephanie C Dulawa', 'Jean P Hornung', 'Xiaoxi Zhuang', 'Dani Brunner', 'Mark A Geyer', 'René Hen']	Neuron	In order to determine the distribution and function of the 5-HT5A serotonin receptor subtype, we generated knockout mice lacking the 5-HT5A gene. Comparative autoradiography studies of brains of wild-type (wt) and 5-HT5A knockout (5A-KO) mice revealed the existence of binding sites with high affinity for [125I]LSD that correspond to 5-HT5A receptors and that are concentrated in the olfactory bulb, neocortex, and medial habenula. When exposed to novel environments, the 5A-KO mice displayed increased exploratory activity but no change in anxiety-related behaviors. In addition, the stimulatory effect of LSD on exploratory activity was attenuated in 5A-KO mice. These results suggest that 5-HT5A receptors modulate the activity of neural circuits involved specifically in exploratory behavior and suggest that some of the psychotropic effects of LSD may be mediated by 5-HT5A receptors.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300807126	244
N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate‐triggered neuronal death in organotypic hippocampal cultures is endocytic, autophagic and mediated by the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase pathway	2003.0	['Tiziana Borsello', 'Karine Croquelois', 'Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Peter Gh Clarke']	European journal of neuroscience	Acute excitotoxic neuronal death was studied in rat organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to 100 µmN‐methyl‐d‐aspartate. Fulgurant death of pyramidal neurons occurred in the CA1 and CA3 regions and was already detectable within 2 h of the N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate administration. Morphologically, the neuronal death was neither apoptotic nor necrotic but had the hallmarks of autophagic neuronal death, as shown by acid phosphatase histochemistry in both CA1 and CA3 and by electron microscopy in CA1. The dying neurons also manifested strong endocytosis of horseradish peroxidase or microperoxidase, occurring probably by a fluid phase mechanism, and followed, surprisingly, by nuclear entry. In addition to these autophagic and endocytic characteristics, there were indications that the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase pathway was activated. Its target c‐Jun was selectively phosphorylated in CA1, CA3 and the …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02757.x	202
Respiratory failure and unilateral caudal brainstem infarction	1990.0	['J Bogousslavsky', 'R Khurana', 'Jp Deruaz', 'Jp Hornung', 'F Regli', 'R Janzer', 'C Perret']	Annals of neurology: official journal of the american neurological association and the child neurology society	We report clinicotopographic correlations in 2 patients with central hypoventilation and unilateral infarct in the caudal brainstem. One patient had nearly complete loss of ventilation involving both automatic and voluntary components. He showed no ventilator response during a CO2 retention test (Paco2 62 mm Hg, Pao2 82 mm Hg), while consciousness was preserved until death. The infarct involved the reticular formation, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus retroambiguus on the right but spared the dorsal motor nucleus of the tenth cranial nerve, and sensory and corticospinal tracts. The second patient showed hypoventilation more selectively involving automatic responses (Ondine's curse). The infarct involved the medullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus but spared the nucleus tractus solitarius. We suggest that unilateral involvement of pontomedullary reticular formation and …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.410280511	169
Transient neuronal populations are required to guide callosal axons: a role for semaphorin 3C	2009.0	['Mathieu Niquille', 'Sonia Garel', 'Fanny Mann', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Belkacem Otsmane', 'Sébastien Chevalley', 'Carlos Parras', 'Francois Guillemot', 'Patricia Gaspar', 'Yuchio Yanagawa', 'Cécile Lebrand']	Plos biology	The corpus callosum (CC) is the main pathway responsible for interhemispheric communication. CC agenesis is associated with numerous human pathologies, suggesting that a range of developmental defects can result in abnormalities in this structure. Midline glial cells are known to play a role in CC development, but we here show that two transient populations of midline neurons also make major contributions to the formation of this commissure. We report that these two neuronal populations enter the CC midline prior to the arrival of callosal pioneer axons. Using a combination of mutant analysis and in vitro assays, we demonstrate that CC neurons are necessary for normal callosal axon navigation. They exert an attractive influence on callosal axons, in part via Semaphorin 3C and its receptor Neuropilin-1. By revealing a novel and essential role for these neuronal populations in the pathfinding of a major cerebral commissure, our study brings new perspectives to pathophysiological mechanisms altering CC formation.	https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000230	150
Distribution of two morphologically distinct subsets of serotoninergic axons in the cerebral cortex of the marmoset	1990.0	['Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Jean‐marc Fritschy', 'Istvan Törk']	Journal of comparative neurology	The serotoninergic innervation of the marmoset (New World monkey, Callithrix jacchus) cerebral cortex has been analyzed by using immunocytochemistry. The use of a sensitive monoclonal antibody against serotonin allowed the visualization of the fine morphology of individual axons. Two types of terminal axons were demonstrated: one has sparse, small, ovoid varicosities (dia. less than 1 μm), and the other has large, spheroidal varicosities (up to 5 μm in dia.), which are more densely clustered. The first type of axon is distributed through all cortical layers, with a characteristic laminar distribution that varies from area to area. The second type of axons was distributed sparsely in all regions but was markedly denser in the frontal and anterior parietal lobes, and in the hippocampal formation.Axons with large varicosities typically surrounded certain cell bodies and proximal dendrites, forming pericellular arrays, or …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.902970202	128
The human locus coeruleus complex: an immunohistochemical and three dimensional reconstruction study	1989.0	['Kg Baker', 'I Törk', 'J -p Hornung', 'P Halasz']	Experimental brain research	The CA (catecholamine/catecholaminergic) cell populations of the locus coeruleus (LC) and subcoeruleus (SubC) were studied using serial sections of the human brainstem immunostained with an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase. The tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons were plotted in a computer reconstruction system and their number and soma size determined. Serial section computer analysis was then used to create a three dimensional reconstruction of the LC complex. The number of cells containing neuromelanin pigment was also determined and compared with the number of TH-IR cells. In our sample there were 53,900 TH-IR cells in the LC and a further 6260 cells in the SubC. These numbers were very similar to our estimates of the number of cells containing neuromelanin pigment and we concluded that virtually all of these cells were also tyrosine hydroxylase positive …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00274983	124
Gross anatomy in the surgical curriculum in Switzerland: improved cadaver preservation, anatomical models, and course development	2001.0	['P Groscurth', 'P Eggli', 'J Kapfhammer', 'G Rager', 'J‐p Hornung', 'Jdh Fasel']	The anatomical record: an official publication of the american association of anatomists	The invention of new techniques for surgery and interventional radiology demand improved training for ongoing specialists.

Identification of distinct GABAA-receptor subtypes in cholinergic and parvalbumin-positive neurons of the rat and marmoset medial septum—diagonal band complex	1995.0	['B Gao', 'J-p Hornung', 'J-m Fritschy']	Neuroscience	GABAA-receptor heterogeneity is based on a multiplicity of subunits (α1–6, β1–4, γ1–4, δ, ϱ1–2) encoded by distinct genes. Flexibility in GABAergic signal transduction and allosteric modulation is expected to arise from the differential assembly of subunits into receptor subtypes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential diversity of receptor subtypes expressed by defined neuron populations, as identified by their neurotransmitter phenotype. To this end we have determined immunohistochemically the subunit repertoire of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the basal forebrain of rat and marmoset monkey, focusing on the medial septum—diagonal band complex. Co-localization of the GABAA-receptor subunits α1, α3, β2, β3 and γ2 with markers of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons (choline acetyltransferase and parvalbumin, respectively) was assessed by double- and triple …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645229400480S	122
Cytoarchitecture of serotonin‐synthesizing neurons in the pontine tegmentum of the human brain	1991.0	['Kg Baker', 'Gm Halliday', 'P Halasz', 'J‐p Hornung', 'Lb Geffen', 'Rgh Cotton', 'I Törk']	Synapse	We have employed immunohistochemical and morphometric procedures to study serotonin‐synthesizing (PH8‐immunoreactive) neurons in the pontine reticular formation of the adult human. PH8‐immunoreactive neurons were found in three cytoarchitectural regions: the median rahpe nucleus (MnR), oral pontine reticular nucleus (PnO), and supralemniscal region (group B9). On the basis of cell size, morphology, and position, it was possible to distinguish distinct subgroups within the MnR (dorsal, midline, and paramedian cell clusters) and within the PnO (dorsal and central cell clusters), whereas within the B9 there were no distinct cell clusters. We have estimated that there are approximately 125,000 PH8‐immunoreactive neurons in the human pontine tegmentum; 64,400 in the MnR, 30,700 in PnO and 29,000 in B9.

The effect of liquid silicone on the rabbit retina: histologic and ultrastructural study	1986.0	['Michel Gonvers', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Christian De Courten']	Archives of ophthalmology	• Silicone oil was injected into 23 rabbit eyes, which had undergone vitrectomy and which were then examined in the electron microscope six weeks later. Retinal lesions were observed in the outer plexiform layer. They consisted mainly of a subtotal disappearance of the processes of horizontal and bipolar cells and of the synaptic terminals of the photoreceptors. The lesions were seen only in areas of the retina that had been in permanent contact with the oil bubble. They did not depend on the purity of the silicone oil injected.	https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/article-abstract/636152	114
The selective innervation by serotoninergic axons of calbindin‐containing interneurons in the neocortex and hippocampus of the marmoset	1992.0	['Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Mr Celio']	Journal of comparative neurology	The serotoninergic input to the mammalian cerebral cortex originates in the median and the dorsal raphe nuclei. Median raphe neurons have been previously shown to give rise to beaded varicose axons which form dense pericellular arrays (baskets) surrounding the soma and the proximal dendrites of certain cortical neurons. In the present study, we have searched for specific markers characterizing the neurons of the marmoset neocortex and hippocampus surrounded by these thick varicose serotonin‐containing fibers. The non‐pyramidal nature of these neurons, suggested by their dendritic arborization, was correlated, in immunocytochemical experiments with double‐labelling to demonstrate their surrounding serotonin‐containing basket and their content of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) or of the calcium‐binding protein calbindin. Another calcium‐binding protein common in numerous non‐pyramidal …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.903200404	110
Improved fertilization and implantation rates after non-touch zona pellucida microdrilling of mouse oocytes with a 1.48 μm diode laser beam	1996.0	['M Germond', 'D Nocera', 'A Senn', 'K Rink', 'G Delacréaz', 'T Pedrazzini', 'Jp Hornung']	Human reproduction	The safety of microdrilling the zona pellucida of moose oocytes with a 1.48 μm diode laser has been investigated by determining the ability of mouse oocytes to fertilize in vitro and develop in vivo. Mice born after transfer of control and zona pelludda-microdrilled embryos into foster mothers were submitted to anatomical and immunohisto-chemical investigations, and their aptitude to breed was assessed in two subsequent generations. Decolonization of the oocytes with hyaluronidase induced a reduction of the fertilization and implantation rates, which was attributed to a zona hardening phenomenon. After laser zona pellucida microdrilling, these rates were restored to those obtained with embryos derived from untreated oocyte-cumulus complexes. Pups derived from zona pellucida microdrilled embryos were comparable with those obtained from control embryos, confirming the lack of deleterious effects of the …	https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/11/5/1043/667464	104
Developmental profile of GABAA‐receptors in the marmoset monkey: Expression of distinct subtypes in pre‐and postnatal brain	1996.0	['Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Jean‐marc Fritschy']	Journal of comparative neurology	Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A‐receptors are expressed in fetal mammalian brain before the onset of synaptic inhibition, suggesting their involvement in brain development. In this study, we have analyzed the maturation of the GABAA‐receptor in the marmoset monkey forebrain to determine whether distinct receptor subtypes are expressed at particular stages of pre‐ and postnatal ontogeny. The distribution of the subunits α1, α2, and β2,3 was investigated immunohistochemically between embryonic day 100 (6 weeks before birth) and adulthood. Prenatally, the α2‐ and β2,3‐subunit‐immunoreactivity (‐IR) was prominent throughout the forebrain, whereas the α1‐subunit‐IR appeared in selected regions shortly before birth. The α2‐subunit‐IR disappeared gradually to become restricted to a few regions in adult forebrain. By contrast, the α1‐subunit‐IR increased dramatically after birth and replaced the α2 …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960408)367:3%3C413::AID-CNE7%3E3.0.CO;2-8	102
Endocytosis and autophagy in dying neurons: an ultrastructural study in chick embryos	1989.0	['Jp Hornung', 'H Koppel', 'Pgh Clarke']	Journal of comparative neurology	In an effort to understand naturally occurring neuronal death in the developing isthmo‐optic nucleus, we have accentuated one of its most probably causes, failure to receive adequate trophic maintenance from the axonal terminal zone in the retina, and have studied the dying neurons ultrastructurally. Retrograde trophic maintenance was blocked by means of intraocularly injected colchicine, which caused all the isthmo‐optic neurons to die by just one of the two or more kinds of cell death that they undergo during normal development. The present paper deals with the very prominent cytoplasmic aspects of this kind of cell death, notably the uptake of exogenous horseradish peroxidase and autophagy. There were also nuclear changes, which are dealt with mainly in the accompanying paper (Clarke and Hornung, J. Comp. Neurol. 283: 438–449, '89).Numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles occurred in both soma and …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.902830310	98
Selective Neurofilament (SMI-32, FNP-7 and N200) Expression in Subpopulations of Layer V Pyramidal Neurons In Vivo and In Vitro	2004.0	['Courtney Cj Voelker', 'Nathalie Garin', 'Jeremy Sh Taylor', 'Beat H Gähwiler', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Zoltán Molnár']	Cerebral cortex	There are two main types of layer V pyramidal neurons in rat cortex. Type I neurons have tufted apical dendrites extending into layer I, produce bursts of action potentials and project to subcortical targets (spinal cord, superior colliculus and pontine nuclei). Type II neurons have apical dendrites, which arborize in layers II–IV, do not produce bursts of action potentials and project to ipsilateral and contralateral cortex. The specific expression of different genes and proteins in these two distinct layer V neurons is unknown. To distinguish between distinct subpopulations, fluorescent microspheres were injected into subcortical targets (labeling type I neurons) or primary somatosensory cortex (labeling type II neurons) of adult rats. After transport, cortical sections were processed for immunohistochemistry using various antibodies. This study demonstrated that antigens recognized by SMI-32, N200 and FNP-7 antibodies …	https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/14/11/1276/331459	96
Glutathione deficit during development induces anomalies in the rat anterior cingulate GABAergic neurons: relevance to schizophrenia	2006.0	['Jan-harry Cabungcal', 'Dominique Nicolas', 'Rudolf Kraftsik', 'Michel Cuénod', 'Kim Q Do', 'Jean-pierre Hornung']	Neurobiology of disease	A series of studies in schizophrenic patients report a decrease of glutathione (GSH) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebrospinal fluid, a decrease in mRNA levels for two GSH synthesizing enzymes and a deficit in parvalbumin (PV) expression in a subclass of GABA neurons in PFC. GSH is an important redox regulator, and its deficit could be responsible for cortical anomalies, particularly in regions rich in dopamine innervation. We tested in an animal model if redox imbalance (GSH deficit and excess extracellular dopamine) during postnatal development would affect PV-expressing neurons. Three populations of interneurons immunolabeled for calcium-binding proteins were analyzed quantitatively in 16-day-old rat brain sections. Treated rats showed specific reduction in parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, but not for calbindin and calretinin. These results provide experimental evidence …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969996106000052	94

The thalamic projection to cat visual cortex: ultrastructure of neurons identified by Golgi impregnation or retrograde horseradish peroxidase transport	1981.0	['Jp Hornung', 'Lj Garey']	Neuroscience	Specific afferents to the primary visual cortex of the cat were identified by electron microscopy after electrolytic lesions of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Postsynaptic target neurons were marked by either Golgi impregnation or horseradish peroxidase retrogradely transported from the opposite visual cortex. The type and the location of identified neurons were determined by light microscopy before further investigation by electron microscopy. Different pyramidal neurons have relatively homogeneous ultrastructural characteristics, but non-pyramidal neurons, divisible into large and small, spiny, sparsely-spiny and non-spiny, vary in their synaptology. Thalamo-cortical afferents have been found to all neuronal types examined in layer IV and lower layer III, including horseradish peroxidase-filled callosal cells. These include pyramidal cells of layer III which receive thalamo-cortical afferents mainly on spines of apical and …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306452281900701	87

The ciliogenic transcription factor RFX3 regulates early midline distribution of guidepost neurons required for corpus callosum development	2012.0	['Carine Benadiba', 'Dario Magnani', 'Mathieu Niquille', 'Laurette Morle', 'Delphine Valloton', 'Homaira Nawabi', 'Aouatef Ait-lounis', 'Belkacem Otsmane', 'Walter Reith', 'Thomas Theil', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Cecile Lebrand', 'Benedicte Durand']	Plos genetics	The corpus callosum (CC) is the major commissure that bridges the cerebral hemispheres. Agenesis of the CC is associated with human ciliopathies, but the origin of this default is unclear. Regulatory Factor X3 (RFX3) is a transcription factor involved in the control of ciliogenesis, and Rfx3–deficient mice show several hallmarks of ciliopathies including left–right asymmetry defects and hydrocephalus. Here we show that Rfx3–deficient mice suffer from CC agenesis associated with a marked disorganisation of guidepost neurons required for axon pathfinding across the midline. Using transplantation assays, we demonstrate that abnormalities of the mutant midline region are primarily responsible for the CC malformation. Conditional genetic inactivation shows that RFX3 is not required in guidepost cells for proper CC formation, but is required before E12.5 for proper patterning of the cortical septal boundary and hence accurate distribution of guidepost neurons at later stages. We observe focused but consistent ectopic expression of Fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) at the rostro commissural plate associated with a reduced ratio of GLIoma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 3 (GLI3) repressor to activator forms. We demonstrate on brain explant cultures that ectopic FGF8 reproduces the guidepost neuronal defects observed in Rfx3 mutants. This study unravels a crucial role of RFX3 during early brain development by indirectly regulating GLI3 activity, which leads to FGF8 upregulation and ultimately to disturbed distribution of guidepost neurons required for CC morphogenesis. Hence, the RFX3 mutant mouse model brings novel understandings of …	https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002606	79
Contribution to the surgical anatomy of the ligaments of the rectum	2000.0	['M Nano', 'Hm Dal Corso', 'G Lanfranco', 'M Ferronato', 'Jp Hornung']	Diseases of the colon & rectum	PURPOSE:Many authors have discussed the presence and the importance of the lateral ligaments of the rectum. Our contribution aims at clarifying some aspects of surgical anatomy that help in the preservation of the urogenital functions and may influence the surgical practice.METHODS:From 1994 to 1998 we examined 27 fresh cadavers and five embalmed pelves. We performed all dissections with a technique similar to that used for the surgical mobilization of the rectum.RESULTS:The lateral ligaments of the rectum are trapezoid structures originating from mesorectum and are anchored to the endopelvic fascia; as lateral extensions of the mesorectum, they must be included in the surgical specimen. According to our results, three main structures can be recognized laterally to the rectum: 1) the lateral ligament, which does not contain important structures; 2) the inferior hypogastric plexus and the urogenital bundle …	https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/Abstract/2000/43110/Contribution_to_the_surgical_anatomy_of_the.22.aspx	76
The neuronatomy of the serotonergic system	2010.0	['Jean-pierre Hornung']		Neurons using serotonin as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system are restricted to the brainstem, centered on the midline raphe nuclei, extending into the subnuclei of the lateral reticular formation. These neurons divide into two populations. A rostral group resides in the midbrain and rostral pons (caudal linear, dorsal and median raphe nuclei), with a major projection targeted to the forebrain. A caudal group located in the caudal pons and the medulla (raphe magnus, obscurus and pallidus nuclei, lateral medullary reticular formation) has a major projection targeted to the spinal cord. Both groups have projections to the brainstem. Subnuclei of the serotonergic system have distinctive afferent and efferent connections, with some entities more specifically linked to the sensory, motor or limbic systems.

Monoaminergic afferents to cortex modulate structural plasticity in the barrelfield of the mouse	1994.0	['Mc Osterheld-haas', 'H Van Der Loos', 'J-p Hornung']	Developmental brain research	Electrolytic lesions of the follicles of a set of mystacial vibrissae, and their innervation, of the mouse placed during the early postnatal period result in a modification in appearance of the corresponding and of adjacent barrels in the somatosensory cortex of the adult animal. These changes can be evoked during the first 6 days of postnatal life — the so-called critical period. The pattern of these modifications varies with the age of the animal at which the lesion was placed. In order to evaluate the contribution of the monoaminergic cortical input to this type of plasticity, the noradrenergic and/or serotonergic afferents to the cerebral cortex of newborn mice were destroyed by systemic administration of various selective neurotoxic drugs (6-hydroxydopamine, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine).

Laminar development of the mouse barrel cortex: effects of neurotoxins against monoamines	1996.0	['Mc Osterheld-haas', 'Jp Hornung']	Experimental brain research	The rodent somatosensory cortex is characterized by a unique cellular organization in the field of representation of the whiskers, called the barrelfield, which develops in layer IV during the 1st postnatal week in parallel with the establishment of the thalamo-cortical connections. This area is transiently densely innervated by serotonergic afferents during this period. Serotonin depletion delays the formation of barrels in the rat somatosensory cortex. However, no information is available to date on the time-course of the laminar differentiation of the cortex after monoaminergic depletion and the relative contribution of different monoaminergic inputs to this process. To address these issues, newborn mice were treated with selective neurotoxins (6-hydroxydopamine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine) at birth to destroy the catecholaminergic and monoaminergic cortical innervation, respectively. The parietal cortex of these …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00228550	70

Excess of serotonin affects neocortical pyramidal neuron migration	2011.0	['O Riccio', 'Moritz Jacobshagen', 'B Golding', 'Laszlo Vutskits', 'Denis Jabaudon', 'Jp Hornung', 'Ag Dayer']	Translational psychiatry	The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key molecule involved in the homeostasis of extracellular levels of serotonin and is regulated developmentally. Genetic deletion of SERT in rodents increases extracellular levels of serotonin and affects cellular processes involved in neocortical circuit assembly such as barrel cortex wiring and cortical interneuron migration. Importantly, pharmacological blockade of SERT during brain development leads to phenotypes relevant to psychiatry in rodents and to an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders in humans. Furthermore, developmental adversity interacts with genetically-driven variations of serotonin function in humans and nonhuman primates to increase the risk for a variety of stress-related phenotypes. In this study, we investigate whether an excess of serotonin affects the migration of neocortical pyramidal neurons during development. Using in utero electroporation …	https://www.nature.com/articles/tp201149	62
Serotoninergic system in the brainstem of the marmoset: A combined immunocytochemical and three‐dimensional reconstruction study	1988.0	['Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Jean‐marc Fritschy']	Journal of comparative neurology	The distribution and morphology of serotoninergic neurons in the marmoset (New‐World monkey) brainstem were studied by immunocytochemistry and computer‐assisted threevdimensional reconstruction. The cytoarchitectonic localization of serotoninergic neurons was ascertained in series of adjacent immunostained and Nissl‐stained sections, and the extent and shape of the serotoninergic nuclei were visualized by computer reconstruction. The overall distribution of the immunoreactive neurons is comparable to that already described for several species of primates. The serotoninergic nuclei are spatially well segregated into an anterior and a posterior group. The anterior group, in the mesencephalon and the rostral pons, contains the largest population of serotoninergic neurons. These neurons are not confined to the raphe nuclei near the midline, but rather expand laterally in the reticular formation. This …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.902700402	62
Dopamine affects parvalbumin expression during cortical development in vitro	1999.0	['Linda L Porter', 'Elena Rizzo', 'Jean-pierre Hornung']	Journal of neuroscience	This study was undertaken to determine how dopamine influences cortical development. It focused on morphogenesis of GABAergic neurons that contained the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). Organotypic slices of frontoparietal cortex were taken from neonatal rats, cultured with or without dopamine, harvested daily (4–30 d), and immunostained for parvalbumin. Expression of parvalbumin occurred in the same regional and laminar sequence as in vivo. Expression in cingulate and entorhinal preceded that in lateral frontoparietal cortices. Laminar expression progressed from layer V to VI and finally II-IV. Somal labeling preceded fiber labeling by 2 d.Dopamine accelerated PV expression. In treated slices, a dense band of PV-immunoreactive neurons appeared in layer V at 7 d in vitro (DIV), and in all layers of frontoparietal cortex at 14 DIV, whereas in control slices such labeling did not appear until 14 and …	https://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/20/8990.short	61
Morphology of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the human cerebral cortex	1989.0	['J -p Hornung', 'I Törk', 'N De Tribolet']	Experimental brain research	In freshly fixed biopsies of human cerebral cortex obtained at surgery, immunocytochemical staining with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate limiting biosynthetic enzyme for catecholamines) revealed, in addition to a dense axonal plexus, a population of immunoreactive cell bodies. The neuronal nature of these cells was ascertained by: i) the presence of a rich rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cell body and of synapses on the cell body and dendrites, and ii) the demonstration of the lack of reactivity with the astroglial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, in the tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells. The tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons were found in all areas of cortex sampled, and were located almost exclusively in the infragranular layers. Most tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells were bipolar and were vertically oriented, but a few had a multipolar or horizontal …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00253618	56
A direct pathway from thalamus to visual callosal neurons in cat	1980.0	['Jp Hornung', 'Lj Garey']	Experimental brain research	Horseradish peroxidase was injected in the right visual cortex and a large electrolytic lesion made in the left lateral geniculate nucleus of an adult cat. Neurons of origin of the callosal projection to the injected cortex were identified by retrograde labelling and selected for electron microscopic study. Degenerating thalamo-cortical axon terminals were found to contact a labelled stellate cell in layer IV and a labelled pyramidal cell in layer III at the border region of areas 17 and 18. We conclude that there is a monosynaptic pathway from lateral geniculate nucleus to the cells of origin of callosal axons to the contralateral visual cortex.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00237940	48
Distribution of GABA-containing neurons in human frontal cortex: a quantitative immunocytochemical study	1994.0	['Jean-pierre Hornung', 'N De Tribolet']	Anatomy and embryology	Fresh biopsy specimens of human cerebral cortex were collected from patients suffering from deep-seated tumors requiring resection. GABAergic neurons were revealed in 50-μm-thick sections, for pre-embedding, and 1-μm-thick sections, for post-embedding GABA immunocytochemistry. In both thick and thin sections, the reaction product was found in neuronal cell bodies and in small profiles in the neuropil. In both preparations, GABA-containing somata were distributed evenly throughout the depth of the cortex. As best appreciated in the thicker sections, GABA-immunoreactive neurons belonged to a variety of morphological cell types with multipolar, bitufted or bipolar, and horizontal dendritic arbors. In the semi-thin sections sampled in the frontal cortex, the proportion of these neurons could be accurately evaluated and was found to be 21.2%±4.8% of all cortical neurons. The average size of GABA …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00185772	47
Morphology and distribution of neuropeptide-containing neurons in human cerebral cortex	1992.0	['Jp Hornung', 'N De Tribolet', 'I Törk']	Neuroscience	Biopsies of human cerebral cortex were fixed by immersion and immunostained for the detection of neuropeptides in neuronal cell bodies and axons. Four neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, substance P and cholecystokinin) were visualized in a series of adjacent sections. All populations of immunoreactive neurons had a morphology characteristic of interneurons, with variations in dendritic arborizations and laminar distribution. The cholecystokinin-immunoreactive neurons were most numerous in the supragranular layers, whereas neurons containing the other three peptides occurred mainly in infragranular layers, or even in neurons populating the subcortical white matter. Quantitatively, each population of neuropeptide-containing neurons accounted for 1.4–2.5% of the total neuronal population. The distribution of these neurons varied slightly between cytoarchitectonic divisions, with substance P- and …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645229290321R	41
Raphe nuclei	2004.0	['Jean-pierre Hornung']	The human nervous system. elsevier academic press, london	The raphe nuclei constitute a collection of cell groups distributed in the midline region of the tegmentum, from the rostral midbrain to the spinal cord transition at the pyramidal tract decussation. The term raphe refers to a seam or a ridge along the midsagittal plane of the body where left and right side structures fuse or join. In the brain stem, the union of both sides along the midline region is underlined by the crossing of numerous tracts, the most prominent ones being the decussation of the superior cerebellar tract in the mesencephalon, and, in the medulla oblongata, the medial	https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_Hw0LcRLwYoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA424&dq=info:-CEFnmw36KsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=fLQVDl1fmf&sig=sLGAGTHfiiCgNVqfu2yF17ibV1Y	40
Neonatal serotonin depletion affects developing and mature mouse cortical neurons	2000.0	['Jacques Durig', 'Jean-pierre Hornung']	Neuroreport	The early expression of neurotransmitters and receptors in the developing brain has brought attention to their potential contribution in modulating neuronal developmental processes. Monoamines are among the first neurotransmitter systems to develop during embryogenesis. Depletion of neocortical serotonin or catecholamine afferents with selective neurotoxins resulted in a permanent alteration of the dendritic arborization of calretinin-containing interneurons, and a transient delay of parvalbumin and calbindin expression in a number of cortical neurones during the second postnatal week. The expression pattern of other developmentally regulated proteins, such as two subunits of the GABA A receptor, was not altered. Depletion of serotonin, and in part catecholamines, appeared to perturb several developmental processes of the cerebral cortex which would interfere with both its maturation and adult circuitry.	https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/fulltext/2000/03200/neonatal_serotonin_depletion_affects_developing.35.aspx	40
Extrathalamic ascending projections to physiologically identified fields of the cat auditory cortex	1989.0	['Em Rouiller', 'Jp Hornung', 'F De Ribaupierre']	Hearing research	The neurons of origin of ascending extrathalarnic projections to the auditory cortex were labeled retrogradely with WGA-HRP injected in physiologically identified auditory cortical fields of the cat (anterior (AAF), primary (AI), posterior (PAF) and secondary (All) fields). After injection in the tonotopically organized auditory cortical fields (AAF, AI and PAF), labeled neurons were distributed in 7 extrathalamic subcortical regions included in one or the other of 2 distinct systems of ascending projections to the neocortex. In the ‘diffuse’ system of projection, labeled neurons were observed bilaterally in the locus coeruleus, the nuclei of the raphe, the lateral hypothalamus, ipsilaterally in the ventromedial mesencephalic tegmentum and the basal forebrain; in the ‘accessory sensory’ system of projection, labeled neurons were found ipsilaterally in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus and bilaterally in the …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378595589901640	40
Early fetal expression of GABAB1 and GABAB2 receptor mRNAs on the development of the rat central nervous system	2003.0	['Myeong Ok Kim', 'Shupeng Li', 'Moon Seok Park', 'Jean-pierre Hornung']	Developmental brain research	GABAB receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate slow onset and prolonged effects of GABA in the central nervous system (CNS). While they appear to influence developmental events, depending on where they are found at a synapse, little, if anything, is known as to the expression of GABAB1 and GABAB2 receptor mRNAs during the early developmental stages. We used in situ hybridization and RNase protection assays (RPA) to investigate the early fetal expression of GABAB1 and GABAB2 receptor mRNAs on the development of the rat CNS. Our in situ studies defined a pattern of early and strong GABAB1 receptor mRNA expression in the spinal cord, medullar and cerebral cortex neuroepithelium of discrete brain regions on gestational day (GD) 11.5. On GD 12.5, GABAB1 receptor mRNAs were found in the hippocampal formation, cerebral cortex, intermediate and posterior neuroepithelium, and …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165380603000993	38
Medium‐sized neurofilament protein related to maturation of a subset of cortical neurons	1999.0	['Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Beat M Riederer']	Journal of comparative neurology	Neurofilaments are typical structures of the neuronal cytoskeleton and participate in the formation and stabilization of the axonal and dendritic architecture. In this study, we have characterized a murine monoclonal antibody, FNP7, that is directed against the medium‐sized neurofilament subunit NF‐M. This antibody identifies a subset of neurons in the cerebral cortex of various species including human and in organotypic cultures of rat cortex. In the neocortex of all species examined, the antibody labels pyramidal cells in layers III, V, and VI, with a distinctive laminar distribution between architectonic boundaries. In comparison with other antibodies directed against NF‐M, the FNP7 antibody identifies on blots two forms of NF‐M that appear relatively late during development, at the time when dynamic growth of processes changes to the stabilization of the formed processes.

NG2 glia are required for vessel network formation during embryonic development	2015.0	['Shilpi Minocha', 'Delphine Valloton', 'Isabelle Brunet', 'Anne Eichmann', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Cecile Lebrand']	Elife	The NG2+ glia, also known as polydendrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, represent a new entity among glial cell populations in the central nervous system. However, the complete repertoire of their roles is not yet identified. The embryonic NG2+ glia originate from the Nkx2.1+ progenitors of the ventral telencephalon. Our analysis unravels that, beginning from E12.5 until E16.5, the NG2+ glia populate the entire dorsal telencephalon. Interestingly, their appearance temporally coincides with the establishment of blood vessel network in the embryonic brain. NG2+ glia are closely apposed to developing cerebral vessels by being either positioned at the sprouting tip cells or tethered along the vessel walls. Absence of NG2+ glia drastically affects the vascular development leading to severe reduction of ramifications and connections by E18.5. By revealing a novel and fundamental role for NG2+ glia, our study brings new perspectives to mechanisms underlying proper vessels network formation in embryonic brains.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09102.001	https://elifesciences.org/articles/9102	36
Loss of ATF2 function leads to cranial motoneuron degeneration during embryonic mouse development	2011.0	['Julien Ackermann', 'Garry Ashton', 'Steve Lyons', 'Dominic James', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Nic Jones', 'Wolfgang Breitwieser']	Plos one	The AP-1 family transcription factor ATF2 is essential for development and tissue maintenance in mammals. In particular, ATF2 is highly expressed and activated in the brain and previous studies using mouse knockouts have confirmed its requirement in the cerebellum as well as in vestibular sense organs. Here we present the analysis of the requirement for ATF2 in CNS development in mouse embryos, specifically in the brainstem. We discovered that neuron-specific inactivation of ATF2 leads to significant loss of motoneurons of the hypoglossal, abducens and facial nuclei. While the generation of ATF2 mutant motoneurons appears normal during early development, they undergo caspase-dependent and independent cell death during later embryonic and foetal stages. The loss of these motoneurons correlates with increased levels of stress activated MAP kinases, JNK and p38, as well as aberrant accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, NF-H and NF-M, known substrates for these kinases. This, together with other neuropathological phenotypes, including aberrant vacuolisation and lipid accumulation, indicates that deficiency in ATF2 leads to neurodegeneration of subsets of somatic and visceral motoneurons of the brainstem. It also confirms that ATF2 has a critical role in limiting the activities of stress kinases JNK and p38 which are potent inducers of cell death in the CNS.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019090	36
Transitory uptake of serotonin in the developing sensory pathways of the common marmoset	2006.0	['C Lebrand', 'P Gaspar', 'D Nicolas', 'Jp Hornung']	Journal of comparative neurology	Serotonin (5‐HT) affects brain development during sensitive developmental periods. In rodents, transient sites of high affinity capture of 5‐HT were demonstrated in the primary sensory neurons and in the sensory thalamocortical afferents. This uptake is required to adjust 5‐HT receptor stimulation during the formation of sensory maps. To determine whether similar mechanisms exist in primates, we analyzed staged embryos and postnatal pups in the common marmoset (total gestation time, 142 days). Immunocytochemical analyses were performed using antisera to 5‐HT, to the serotonin transporter (SERT), and to the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2). 5‐HT, SERT, and VMAT2 labeled the raphe neurons and their terminal network from embryonic day (E)70 to adulthood. In addition, from E70–130 VMAT2 and SERT were observed in all the sensory cranial nerves, the olfactory nerve, the gustatory, the …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.21137	36

Changes in the nuclei of dying neurons as studied with thymidine autoradiography	1989.0	['Pgh Clarke', 'Jp Hornung']	Journal of comparative neurology	Thymidine autoradiography has been used at light and electron microscopic levels to elucidate intracellular events during the death in chick embryos of isthmo‐optic neurons deprived of trophic maintenance from their axonal target organ, the retina. When the intense cytoplasmic vacuolization described in the accompanying paper (Hornung, Koppel, and Clarke, J. Comp. Neurol. 283: 425–437, '89) was beginning, the nuclei also underwent profound changes. They became more electron dense and shrank; their membranes became more sharply defined and convoluted; they sometimes contained pyknotic balls, but apparently only in the early stages of cell death; all lost more than half of their content of DNA, some of which was transferred to the largest kind of cytoplasmic vacuole. This transfer may have involved the budding off of nuclear regions containing pyknotic balls.

Nkx2. 1 regulates the generation of telencephalic astrocytes during embryonic development	2017.0	['Shilpi Minocha', 'Delphine Valloton', 'Yvan Arsenijevic', 'Jean-rené Cardinaux', 'Raffaella Guidi', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Cécile Lebrand']	Scientific reports	The homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2.1 (NK2 homeobox 1) controls cell differentiation of telencephalic GABAergic interneurons and oligodendrocytes. Here we show that Nkx2.1 also regulates astrogliogenesis of the telencephalon from embryonic day (E) 14.5 to E16.5. Moreover we identify the different mechanisms by which Nkx2.1 controls the telencephalic astrogliogenesis. In Nkx2.1 knockout (Nkx2.1−/−) mice a drastic loss of astrocytes is observed that is not related to cell death. Further, in vivo analysis using BrdU incorporation reveals that Nkx2.1 affects the proliferation of the ventral neural stem cells that generate early astrocytes. Also, in vitro neurosphere assays showed reduced generation of astroglia upon loss of Nkx2.1, which could be due to decreased precursor proliferation and possibly defects in glial specification/differentiation.

The use of ibotenic acid lesions for light and electron microscopic study of anterograde degeneration in the visual pathway of the cat	1980.0	['Lj Garey', 'Jp Hornung']	Neuroscience letters	Ibotenic acid was injected in the lateral geniculate nucleus of cats to investigate the suitability of the technique in studies involving anterograde degeneration in the thalamo-cortical pathway when it is important not to damage fibres of passage at the lesion site. Small injections cause localized degeneration of neuronal somata in the lateral geniculate nucleus, but axons passing through the injected zone remain intact. Degeneration can be localized in visual cortex by light microscopic silver techniques and by electron microscopy. The appearance, density and distribution of degenerating cortical axon terminals is similar to what is found after thalamic electrolytic lesions.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304394080901810	28
Correlation between regional changes in the distributions of GABA-containing neurons and unit response properties in the medial geniculate body of the cat	1990.0	['Em Rouiller', 'M Capt', 'Jp Hornung', 'P Streit']	Hearing research	A consistent change in the distribution of single units as a function of several of their properties of response to clicks, noise and tone bursts was observed along the rostro-caudal axis in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body (vMGB). From posterior to anterior, the proportion of inhibitory response patterns and non-monotonic intensity functions progressively decreased; response latencies were progressively shorter and less dispersed from caudal to rostral. This functional heterogeneity is consistent with the segregation of the thalamocortical interconnections: the anterior part of vMGB projects to the anterior and primary auditory cortical fields, whereas the posterior part of vMGB projects mainly to the posterior auditory cortical field. Changes in the distribution of response properties from posterior to anterior in vMGB were found to be correlated with a progressive decrease of the density of GABA …	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037859559090107Z	26
Two specific populations of GABAergic neurons originating from the medial and the caudal ganglionic eminences aid in proper navigation of callosal axons	2013.0	['Mathieu Niquille', 'Shilpi Minocha', 'Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Nathalie Rufer', 'Delphine Valloton', 'Nicoletta Kessaris', 'Fabienne Alfonsi', 'Tania Vitalis', 'Yuchio Yanagawa', 'Christiane Devenoges', 'Alexandre Dayer', 'Cecile Lebrand']	Developmental neurobiology	The corpus callosum (CC) plays a crucial role in interhemispheric communication. It has been shown that CC formation relies on the guidepost cells located in the midline region that include glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons as well as glial cells. However, the origin of these guidepost GABAergic neurons and their precise function in callosal axon pathfinding remain to be investigated. Here, we show that two distinct GABAergic neuronal subpopulations converge toward the midline prior to the arrival of callosal axons. Using in vivo and ex vivo fate mapping we show that CC GABAergic neurons originate in the caudal and medial ganglionic eminences (CGE and MGE) but not in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). Time lapse imaging on organotypic slices and in vivo analyses further revealed that CC GABAergic neurons contribute to the normal navigation of callosal axons.

Nkx2.1-derived astrocytes and neurons together with Slit2 are indispensable for anterior commissure formation	2015.0	['Shilpi Minocha', 'Delphine Valloton', 'Athena R Ypsilanti', 'Hubert Fiumelli', 'Elizabeth A Allen', 'Yuchio Yanagawa', 'Oscar Marin', 'Alain Chédotal', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Cécile Lebrand']	Nature communications	Guidepost cells present at and surrounding the midline provide guidance cues that orient the growing axons through commissures. Here we show that the transcription factor Nkx2.1 known to control the specification of GABAergic interneurons also regulates the differentiation of astroglia and polydendrocytes within the mouse anterior commissure (AC). Nkx2.1-positive glia were found to originate from three germinal regions of the ventral telencephalon. Nkx2.1-derived glia were observed in and around the AC region by E14.5. Thereafter, a selective cell ablation strategy showed a synergistic role of Nkx2.1-derived cells, both GABAergic interneurons and astroglia, towards the proper formation of the AC. Finally, our results reveal that the Nkx2.1-regulated cells mediate AC axon guidance through the expression of the repellent cue, Slit2.

Distribution of postsynaptic GABAA receptor aggregates in the deep cerebellar nuclei of normal and mutant mice	2002.0	['Nathalie Garin', 'Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Gérard Escher']	Journal of comparative neurology	In the central nervous system, the aggregation of receptors is crucial for synapse formation and function. To study the role of presynaptic terminals in the maintenance of postsynaptic specializations, we analyzed the synaptic contacts between Purkinje cells and neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei in two in vivo models: the Lurcher and Purkinje cell‐deficient (PCD) mutant mice. These mutants lose their Purkinje cells at different postnatal stages. By using confocal scanner microscopy and immunohistochemistry, we studied the distribution of the α subunit of the γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor (GABAARα1) and gephyrin, one of its anchoring proteins, in relation to the distribution of presynaptic markers, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), or synaptophysin.

Ultrastructure of visual callosal neurons in cat identified by retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase	1981.0	['Jp Hornung', 'Lj Garey']	Journal of neurocytology	The ultrastructure of neurons at the border of areas 17 and 18 of the visual cortex of the cat was studied by the combined use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and electron microscopy. Callosal neurons were retrogradely labelled by injecting HRP at the 17/18 border region of the contralateral hemisphere. They were found mainly in layer III but also in IV and VI. They were most commonly pyramidal cells and less often large, spiny stellate cells. Pyramidal callosal neurons received only symmetrical synapses on their soma and mainly symmetrical (but a few asymmetrical) synapses on their dendritic shafts. Their abundant spines received asymmetrical synapses. The stellate cells were contacted by moderate numbers of symmetrical and asymmetrical axodendritic and axosomatic synapses and also had asymmetrical axospinous contacts.

In turn, the maturation and survival of newborn neurons is regulated by their activity. Here, we tested the effect of a cell-autonomous overexpression of synaptic adhesion molecules on the maturation and survival of neurons born postnatally and on hippocampal-dependent memory performances. Families of adhesion molecules are known to induce pre- and post-synaptic assembly. Using viral targeting, we overexpressed three different synaptic adhesion molecules, SynCAM1, Neuroligin-1B and Neuroligin-2A in newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of 7- to 9-week-old mice. We found that SynCAM1 increased the morphological maturation of dendritic spines and mossy fiber terminals while Neuroligin-1B increased spine density.

Chemical organization of the human cerebral cortex	1995.0	['Jean-pierre Hornung', 'N De Tribolet']	Neurotransmitters in the human brain	The neuronal organization of the cerebral cortex of human and other mammalian species, revealed by various histological techniques, has been largely documented (for review see Peters and Jones, 1984; White, 1991). Two broad morphological categories of neurons are found in the cerebral cortex: the pyramidal neurons, carrying the efferent projections, and the non-pyramidal neurons, with a restricted local axonal arborization. Pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons are further subdivided into distinct cell types characterized by their dendritic and axonal arborizations and their laminar distribution. Afferents to the cerebral cortex can be divided into two groups: thalamic afferents, and extrathalamic afferents. The former arborize mainly in layer IV, over restricted areas of cortex in which they strongly influence the modality of response of the cortical neurons. In contrast, extra-thalamic afferents terminate over …	https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-1853-2_4	15
Can intestinal innervation be preserved in pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer? Results of an anatomical study	2003.0	['Mario Nano', 'H Dal Corso', 'Marco Ferronato', 'Mario Solej', 'Jp Hornung']	Surgical and radiologic anatomy	Twenty dissections were carried out, in all of which the splanchnic nerves, celiac plexuses, capital pancreatic plexus and superior mesenteric plexus were identified and traced. The capital pancreatic plexus was formed from two bundles, the first taking its origin from the right celiac plexus, the second from the superior mesenteric plexus. These two bundles joined together just behind the head of the pancreas. Two preganglionic bundles, a ganglion and two postganglionic bundles composed the superior mesenteric plexus.

Developmental and spatial expression pattern of syntaxin 13 in the mouse central nervous system	2002.0	['Floyd J-c Sarria', 'Stefan Catsicas', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Harald Hirling']	Cell and tissue research	 Vesicular transport involves SNARE (soluble-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor-attachment-protein-receptor) proteins on transport vesicles and on target membranes. Syntaxin 13 is a SNARE enriched in brain, associated with recycling endosomes; its overexpression in PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth. This suggests an important role for receptor recycling during neuronal differentiation. Here we describe the spatiotemporal pattern of syntaxin 13 expression during mouse brain development. During early embryogenesis (E12–E15), it was found in the forebrain ventricular zone and in primary motor and sensory neurons in the brainstem, spinal cord and sensory ganglia. In the forebrain at E15, syntaxin 13 was not detected in neuroblasts in the intermediate zone of the embryonic hemispheric wall, while there was labeling in cortical neurons in deeper layers starting at E15–18, and progressively in later …	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00441-002-0600-5	11

Toward safer thanatopraxy cares: formaldehyde‐releasers use	2019.0	['Vincent Varlet', 'Alain Bouvet', 'Hugues Cadas', 'Jean‐pierre Hornung', 'Silke Grabherr']		Human cadavers constitute very useful educational tools to teach anatomy in medical scholarship and related disciplines such as physiology, for example. However, as biological material, human body is subjected to decay. Thanatopraxy cares such as embalming have been developed to slow down and inhibit this decay, but the formula used for the preservation fluids are mainly formaldehyde (FA)‐based. Very recently, other formulas were developed in order to replace FA, and to avoid its toxicity leading to important environmental and professional exposure concerns. However, these alternative FA‐free fluids are still not validated or commercialized, and their efficiency is still under discussion. In this context, the use of FA‐releasing substances, already used in the cosmetics industry, may offer interesting alternatives in order to reduce professional exposures to FA. Simultaneously, the preservation of the body is …	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joa.13047	9
An organotypic slice culture to study the formation of calyx of Held synapses in-vitro	2017.0	['Elin Kronander', 'Nicolas Michalski', 'Cecile Lebrand', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Ralf Schneggenburger']	Plos one	The calyx of Held, a large axo-somatic relay synapse containing hundreds of presynaptic active zones, is possibly the largest nerve terminal in the mammalian CNS. Studying its initial growth in-vitro might provide insights into the specification of synaptic connection size in the developing brain. However, attempts to maintain calyces of Held in organotypic cultures have not been fruitful in past studies. Here, we describe an organotypic slice culture method in which calyces of Held form in-vitro. We made coronal brainstem slices with an optimized slice angle using newborn mice in which calyces have not yet formed; the presynaptic bushy cells were genetically labeled using the Math5 promoter. After six to nine days of culturing, we readily observed large Math5—positive nerve terminals in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), but not in the neighboring lateral superior olive nucleus (LSO). These calyx—like synapses expressed the Ca2+- sensor Synaptotagmin-2 (Syt-2) and the Ca2+ binding protein Parvalbumin (PV), two markers of developing calyces of Held in vivo. Application of the BMP inhibitor LDN-193189 significantly inhibited the growth of calyx synapses, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term pharmacological manipulation using this organotypic culture method. These experiments provide a method for organotypic culturing of calyces of Held, and show that the formation of calyx—like synapses onto MNTB neurons can be preserved in-vitro. Furthermore, our study adds pharmacological evidence for a role of BMP-signaling in the formation of large calyx of Held synapses.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175964	8
Three-dimensional reconstruction procedure using GKS primitives and software transformations for anatomical studies of the nervous system	1988.0	['J-p Hornung', 'R Kraftsik']		The analysis of morphology or distribution of neurons in the brain requires sectioning of the brain which allows the cells to be viewed with a microscope, and which, moreover, is usually a requirement for the execution of the histological techniques needed to make the nerve cells visible. The section is thin relative to the size of the neuron (electron microscopy) or relative to regions of the brain (light microscopy) of interest in a particular study: Therefore, the spatial information is virtually reduced to a plane.	https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-83492-9_50	8
Expression of the NH2-terminal fragment of RasGAP in pancreatic β-cells increases their resistance to stresses and protects mice from diabetes	2009.0	['Jiang-yan Yang', 'Jöel Walicki', 'Evrim Jaccard', 'Gilles Dubuis', 'Natasa Bulat', 'Jean-pierre Hornung', 'Bernard Thorens', 'Christian Widmann']	Diabetes	Our laboratory has previously established in vitro that a caspase-generated RasGAP NH2-terminal moiety, called fragment N, potently protects cells, including insulinomas, from apoptotic stress. We aimed to determine whether fragment N can increase the resistance of pancreatic β-cells in a physiological setting.A mouse line, called rat insulin promoter (RIP)-N, was generated that bears a transgene containing the rat insulin promoter followed by the cDNA-encoding fragment N. The histology, functionality, and resistance to stress of RIP-N islets were then assessed.Pancreatic β-cells of RIP-N mice express fragment N, activate Akt, and block nuclear factor κB activity without affecting islet cell proliferation or the morphology and cellular composition of islets.

Using a new in-vivo method based on magnetic resonance spec- troscopy, [GSH] was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex of 18 schizophrenics and found to be 52 % lower than in controls (n = 20). This is consistent with the recently observed decreased mRNA levels in fibroblasts of patients (n=32) of the two GSH synthesizing en- zymes (glutathione synthetase (GSS), and glutamate-cysteine ligase M (GCLM) the modulatory subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase). Moreover, the level of GCLM expression in fibroblasts correlates neg- atively with the psychopathology (positive, general and some nega- tive symptoms). Thus, the observed difference in gene expression is not only the cause of low brain [GSH], but is also …	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3778275817130856299&hl=en&oi=scholarr	2

2019 Annual Meeting of the Swiss Society for Sleep Research, Sleep Medicine, and Chronobiology (SSSSC)	2019.0	['Martin Hatzinger']		Background: Uninterrupted periods of sleep and wakefulness are an integral part of a healthy life cycle. However, brief awakenings also occur while being asleep. These are thought to appear randomly and are commonly considered as disruptive or even pathological elements of sleep. Furthermore, strategies to anticipate and prevent awakenings are currently missing. Here, we analysed the timing of microarousals in mouse non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in the light of a novel infraslow oscillation that segregates NREMS into periods of fragility and continuity.Methods: Using polysomnographic recordings, we determined infraslow dynamics of sigma power (10–15 Hz) and microarousals. We used 6 h of total sleep deprivation to increase homeostatic sleep pressure, and 6 h-of selective REM sleep (REMS) deprivation using closed-loop feedback techniques to increase REMS pressure.Results: We find that microarousals in mouse NREMS occur overwhelmingly time-locked during the fragility periods. When homeostatic sleep pressure was increased, fewer fragility periods were interrupted by microarousals. When only REMS pressure was augmented instead, fragility periods became primarily interrupted by transitions into REMS. Specifically, NREMS showed entries into REMS every~ 50 or 100 s, thus coinciding with the periodicity of the infraslow oscillation. Instead, the frequency of microarousals was diminished.Conclusions: We conclude that the timing of microarousals is gated by the fragility periods of the infraslow oscillation that constitute permissive windows for transitions out of NREMS, which can be allocated to NREMS–wake or …	https://www.mdpi.com/2624-5175/1/4/33/htm	0

ULTRASTRUCTURE OF THE THALAMIC PROJECTION TO CAT VISUAL CORTEX.	1981.0	['Lj Garey', 'Jp Hornung']	Pathophysiology of the visual system	Sometimes a spine contacted by a degenerating terminal can be followed to its dendrite and the cell type recognized (Davis, Sterling, 1979). However, very large numbers of sections are needed with tedious serial reconstruction. Alternatively cortical neurons can be labelled with a method enabling their characterization by light microscopy and then examined with electron microscopy in a brain with a lesion in the LGN. In the present study two labelling techniques have been used. In the first, neurons were impregnated by the rapid Golgi method for light microscopic classification and then subjected to the gold toning process of Fair6n et al.(1977). In the second, neurons were retrogradely labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and classified by light microscopy before electron microscopic study (Garey, Hornung, 1980; Hornung, Garey, 1980, 1981).	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16165000004688329488&hl=en&oi=scholarr	0

Gabaergic interneurons Help Bridge the Brain's Communication Gap		['M Niquille', 'S Garel', 'F Mann', 'J Hornung', 'B Otsmane', 'C Parras', 'F Guillemot', 'P Gaspar', 'Y Yanagawa', 'C Lebrand']	Frontiers in neuroscience	Subpopulations of midline glial cells have been shown to guide corpus callosum (CC) axons to the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. While neuronal cells are also present in the developing CC, their role remains obscure. In our work, we show that the CC is transiently populated by numerous glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. These two distinct neuronal populations converge towards the midline before the callosal axons. Time-lapse and 3D imaging studies reveal that these migrating neurons settle in CC and cooperate to form barriers that funnel callosal fibres. In vivo analyses in Mash1 mutant mice which lack CC GABAergic interneurons, and rescue experiments after transplantation of wild-type CC within Mash1-/- brain slices, demonstrate that CC GABAergic interneurons are essential to guide callosal axons at the midline. Moreover, in transplantation experiments of CC neurons into heterotopic regions …	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17137889122005141701&hl=en&oi=scholarr	0
