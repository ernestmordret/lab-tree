0,Peptide mapping by limited proteolysis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and analysis by gel electrophoresis.,1977,Don W Cleveland and Stuart G Fischer and Marc W Kirschner and Ulrich K Laemmli,"A rapid and convenient method for peptide mapping of proteins has been developed. The technique, which is especially suitable for analysis of proteins that have been isolated from gels containg sodium dodecyl sulfate, involves partial enzymatic proteolysis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and analysis of the cleavage products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pattern of peptide fragments produced is characteristic of the protein substrate and the proteolytic enzyme and is highly reproducible. Several common proteases have been used including chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus protease, and papain."
1,Dynamic instability of microtubule growth,1984,Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,We report here that microtubules in vitro coexist in growing and shrinking populations which interconvert rather infrequently. This dynamic instability is a general property of microtubules and may be fundamental in explaining cellular microtubule organization.
2,A protein factor essential for microtubule assembly,1975,Murray D Weingarten and Arthur H Lockwood and Shu-Ying Hwo and Marc W Kirschner,"A heat stable protein essentail for microtubule assembly has been isolated. This protein, which we designate tau (tau), is present in association with tubulin purified from porcine brain by repeated cycles of polymerization. Tau is separated from tubulin by ion exchange chromatography on phosphocellulose. In the absence of tau, tubulin exists entirely as a 6S dimer of two polypeptide chains (alpha and beta tubulin) with a molecular weight of 120,000, which will not assemble into microtubules in vitro. Addition of tau completely restores tubule-forming capacity. Under nonpolymerizing conditions, tau converts 6S dimers to 36S rings-structures which have been implicated as intermediates in tubule formation. Hence, tau appears to act on the 6S tubulin dimer, activating it for polymerization. The unique ability of tau to restore the normal features of in vitro microtubule assembly makes it likely that tau is a major regulator of …"
3,Cyclin is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway,1991,Michael Glotzer and Andrew W Murray and Marc W Kirschner,"Cyclin degradation is the key step governing exit from mitosis and progress into the next cell cycle. When a region in the N terminus of cyclin is fused to a foreign protein, it produces a hybrid protein susceptible to proteolysis at mitosis. During the course of degradation, both cyclin and the hybrid form conjugates with ubiquitin. The kinetic properties of the conjugates indicate that cyclin is degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Thus anaphase may be triggered by the recognition of cyclin by the ubiquitin-conjugating system."
4,Absolute quantification of proteins and phosphoproteins from cell lysates by tandem MS,2003,Scott A Gerber and John Rush and Olaf Stemman and Marc W Kirschner and Steven P Gygi,"A need exists for technologies that permit the direct quantification of  differences in protein and posttranslationally modified protein expression  levels. Here we present a strategy for the absolute quantification (termed  AQUA) of proteins and their modification states. Peptides are synthesized with  incorporated stable isotopes as ideal internal standards to mimic native  peptides formed by proteolysis. These synthetic peptides can also be prepared  with covalent modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation,  etc.) that are chemically identical to naturally occurring posttranslational  modifications. Such AQUA internal standard peptides are then used to precisely  and quantitatively measure the absolute levels of proteins and  posttranslationally modified proteins after proteolysis by using a selected  reaction monitoring analysis in a tandem mass spectrometer. In the present  work, the AQUA strategy was …"
5,Droplet barcoding for single-cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells,2015,Allon M Klein and Linas Mazutis and Ilke Akartuna and Naren Tallapragada and Adrian Veres and Victor Li and Leonid Peshkin and David A Weitz and Marc W Kirschner,"It has long been the dream of biologists to map gene expression at the single-cell level. With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of …"
6,Number and evolutionary conservation of α-and β-tubulin and cytoplasmic β-and γ-actin genes using specific cloned cDNA probes,1980,Don W Cleveland and Margaret A Lopata and Raymond J MacDonald and Nicholas J Cowan and William J Rutter and Marc W Kirschner,"Bacterial clones containing inserted DNA sequences specific for α-tubulin, β-tubulin, β-actin and γ-actin have been constructed from mRNA of embryonic chick brain. Plasmids containing approximately 75, 90 and >90%, respectively, of the sequences present in α-tubulin, β-tubulin and β-actin mRNAs have been isolated as well as clones containing parts of the extensive 3′ untranslated regions of the β- and γ-actin mRNAs. The sequences for the two tubulins do not cross hybridize. Hybridization of labeled, cloned probes for each of the tubulins with chicken DNA digested with several restriction endonucleases reveals about four fragments for α- and four for β-tubulin. This seems to be the number of genes, since both the 5′ and 3′ ends of either cloned tubulin cDNAs hybridize to at least four common fragments in genomic DNA which has been digested with restriction endonucleases. The tubulin probes are able …"
7,A major developmental transition in early Xenopus embryos: I. characterization and timing of cellular changes at the midblastula stage,1982,John Newport and Marc Kirschner,"The Xenopus embryo undergoes 12 rapid synchronous cleavages followed by a period of slower asynchronous divisions more typical of somatic cells. This change in cell cleavage has been termed the midblastula transition (MBT). We show that at the MBT the blastomeres become motile and transcriptionally active for the first time. We have investigated the timing of the MBT and found that it does not depend on cell division, on time since fertilization or on a counting mechanism involving the sequential modification of DNA. Rather, the timing of the MBT depends on reaching a critical ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. We view the MBT as a consequence of the titration of some substance, originally present in the egg, by the exponentially increasing nuclear material. When this substance is exhausted a new cell program is engaged, leading to the acquisition of several new cell properties."
8,Tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin and antagonizes Wnt signalling,2009,Shih-Min A Huang and Yuji M Mishina and Shanming Liu and Atwood Cheung and Frank Stegmeier and Gregory A Michaud and Olga Charlat and Elizabeth Wiellette and Yue Zhang and Stephanie Wiessner and Marc Hild and Xiaoying Shi and Christopher J Wilson and Craig Mickanin and Vic Myer and Aleem Fazal and Ronald Tomlinson and Fabrizio Serluca and Wenlin Shao and Hong Cheng and Michael Shultz and Christina Rau and Markus Schirle and Judith Schlegl and Sonja Ghidelli and Stephen Fawell and Chris Lu and Daniel Curtis and Marc W Kirschner and Christoph Lengauer and Peter M Finan and John A Tallarico and Tewis Bouwmeester and Jeffery A Porter and Andreas Bauer and Feng Cong,"The stability of the Wnt pathway transcription factor β-catenin is tightly regulated by the multi-subunit destruction complex. Deregulated Wnt pathway activity has been implicated in many cancers, making this pathway an attractive target for anticancer therapies. However, the development of targeted Wnt pathway inhibitors has been hampered by the limited number of pathway components that are amenable to small molecule inhibition. Here, we used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits β-catenin-mediated transcription. XAV939 stimulates β-catenin degradation by stabilizing axin, the concentration-limiting component of the destruction complex. Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, we discovered that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2. Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly …"
9,Caspase-3-generated fragment of gelsolin: effector of morphological change in apoptosis,1997,Srinivas Kothakota and Toshifumi Azuma and Christoph Reinhard and Anke Klippel and Jay Tang and Keting Chu and Thomas J McGarry and Marc W Kirschner and Kirston Koths and David J Kwiatkowski and Lewis T Williams,"The caspase-3 (CPP32, apopain, YAMA) family of cysteinyl proteases has been implicated as key mediators of apoptosis in mammalian cells. Gelsolin was identified as a substrate for caspase-3 by screening the translation products of small complementary DNA pools for sensitivity to cleavage by caspase-3. Gelsolin was cleaved in vivo in a caspase-dependent manner in cells stimulated by Fas. Caspase-cleaved gelsolin severed actin filaments in vitro in a Ca2+-independent manner. Expression of the gelsolin cleavage product in multiple cell types caused the cells to round up, detach from the plate, and undergo nuclear fragmentation. Neutrophils isolated from mice lacking gelsolin had delayed onset of both blebbing and DNA fragmentation, following apoptosis induction, compared with wild-type neutrophils. Thus, cleaved gelsolin may be one physiological effector of morphologic change during apoptosis."
10,How proteolysis drives the cell cycle,1996,Randall W King and Raymond J Deshaies and Jan-Michael Peters and Marc W Kirschner,"Oscillations in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) promote progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle. This review examines how proteolysis regulates CDK activity—by degrading CDK activators or inhibitors—and also how proteolysis may directly trigger the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Proteolysis during the cell cycle is mediated by two distinct ubiquitin-conjugation pathways. One pathway, requiring CDC34, initiates DNA replication by degrading a CDK inhibitor. The second pathway, involving a large protein complex called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome, initiates chromosome segregation and exit from mitosis by degrading anaphase inhibitors and mitotic cyclins. Proteolysis therefore drives cell cycle progression not only by regulating CDK activity, but by directly influencing chromosome and spindle dynamics."
11,The interaction between N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex links Cdc42-dependent signals to actin assembly,1999,Rajat Rohatgi and Le Ma and Hiroaki Miki and Marco Lopez and Tomas Kirchhausen and Tadaomi Takenawa and Marc W Kirschner,"Although small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family have been implicated in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton, the exact nature of the linkage has remained obscure. We describe a novel mechanism that links one Rho family member, Cdc42, to actin polymerization. N-WASP, a ubiquitously expressed Cdc42-interacting protein, is required for Cdc42-stimulated actin polymerization in Xenopus egg extracts. The C terminus of N-WASP binds to the Arp2/3 complex and dramatically stimulates its ability to nucleate actin polymerization. Although full-length N-WASP is less effective, its activity can be greatly enhanced by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate. Therefore, N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex comprise a core mechanism that directly connects signal transduction pathways to the stimulation of actin polymerization."
12,Evolvability,1998,Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart,"Evolvability is an organism’s capacity to generate heritable  phenotypic variation. Metazoan evolution is marked by great  morphological and physiological diversification, although the core  genetic, cell biological, and developmental processes are largely  conserved. Metazoan diversification has entailed the evolution of  various regulatory processes controlling the time, place, and  conditions of use of the conserved core processes. These regulatory  processes, and certain of the core processes, have special properties  relevant to evolutionary change. The properties of versatile protein  elements, weak linkage, compartmentation, redundancy, and exploratory  behavior reduce the interdependence of components and confer robustness  and flexibility on processes during embryonic development and in adult  physiology. They also confer evolvability on the organism by reducing  constraints on change and allowing …"
13,Beyond self-assembly: from microtubules to morphogenesis,1986,Marc Kirschner and Tim Mitchison,"The goal of modern cell biology is to explain the structure and behavior of the whole cell in terms of the biochemical properties of its individual components. This has been strikingly successful for many cellular components to which the principles of enzymology and self-assembly have been directly applicable. However, larger, more complex systems still pose formidable problems. In this respect, a major remaining challenge is the satisfactory biochemical description of cell morphology and the related problems of cell movement, cell division, and cell differentiation. Until recently, such a description seemed beyond reach, since the morphology of cells was thought to depend on an intractably large number of specific interactions.A breakthrough in our understanding of cell morphology came in the 1970s when it was first generally appreciated that cells contained extensive arrays of linear polymers that could span great …"
14,Cyclin synthesis drives the early embryonic cell cycle,1989,Andrew W Murray and Marc W Kirschner,We have produced extracts of frog eggs that can perform multiple cell cycles in vitro. Destruction of the endogenous messenger RNA arrests the extracts in interphase. The addition of exogenous cyclin mRNA is sufficient to produce multiple cell cycles. The newly synthesized cyclin protein accumulates during each interphase and is degraded at the end of each mitosis.
15,Expression of a dominant negative mutant of the FGF receptor disrupts mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos,1991,Enrique Amaya and Thomas J Musci and Marc W Kirschner,"Peptide growth factors may play a role in patterning of the early embryo, particularly in the induction of mesoderm. We have explored the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in early Xenopus development by expressing a dominant negative mutant form of the FGF receptor. Using a functional assay in frog oocytes, we found that a truncated form of the receptor effectively abolished wild-type receptor function. Explants from embryos expressing this dominant negative mutant failed to induce mesoderm in response to FGF. In whole embryos the mutant receptor caused specific defects in gastrulation and in posterior development, and overexpression of a wild-type receptor could rescue these developmental defects. These results demonstrate that the FGF signaling pathway plays an important role in early embryogenesis, particularly in the formation of the posterior and lateral mesoderm."
16,The role of cyclin synthesis and degradation in the control of maturation promoting factor activity,1989,Andrew W Murray and Mark J Solomon and Marc W Kirschner,We show that cyclin plays a pivotal role in the control of mitosis. A proteolysis-resistant mutant of cyclin prevents the inactivation of maturation promoting factor and the exit from mitosis both in vivo and in vitro. We have used a fractionated extract to study the activation of MPF by added cyclin protein.

18,A major developmental transition in early Xenopus embryos: II. Control of the onset of transcription,1982,John Newport and Marc Kirschner,"We have shown in the accompanying paper that a developmental transition occurs at the midblastula stage (cleavage 12) in Xenopus embryos, and that this midblastula transition (MBT) is apparently initiated when the ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm reaches a critical value. One manifestation of this transition is the onset of transcription. We show here that a plasmid containing a cloned gene coding for a yeast leucine tRNA comes under developmental control when injected into cleaving eggs. In pre-MBT eggs this plasmid is transiently transcribed and then becomes inactive; however, it becomes transcriptionally active again at the MBT. This pre-MBT suppression of transcription can be reversed by addition of competing DNA. The amount of DNA needed to induce premature transcription is equal to the amount of nuclear DNA present after 12 cleavages (24 ng), suggesting that the MBT is triggered by the DNA through …"
19,A 20S complex containing CDC27 and CDC16 catalyzes the mitosis-specific conjugation of ubiquitin to cyclin B,1995,Randall W King and Jan-Michael Peters and Stuart Tugendreich and Mark Rolfe and Philip Hieter and Marc W Kirschner,"Cyclin B is degraded at the onset of anaphase by a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. We have fractionated mitotic Xenopus egg extracts to identify components required for this process. We find that UBC4 and at least one other ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme can support cyclin B ubiquitination. The mitotic specificity of cyclin ubiquitination is determined by a 20S complex that contains homologs of budding yeast CDC16 and CDC27. Because these proteins are required for anaphase in yeast and mammalian cells, we refer to this complex as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). CDC27 antibodies deplete APC activity, while immunopurified CDC27 complexes are sufficient to complement either interphase extracts or a mixture of recombinant UBC4 and the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. These results suggest that APC functions as a regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets cyclin B for destruction in …"
20,Modulation of the dynamic instability of tubulin assembly by the microtubule-associated protein tau.,1992,David N Drechsel and AA Hyman and Melanie H Cobb and MW Kirschner,"Microtubule-associated proteins (MAP), such as tau, modulate the extent and rate of microtubule assembly and play an essential role in morphogenetic processes, such as axonal growth. We have examined the mechanism by which tau affects microtubule polymerization by examining the kinetics of microtubule assembly and disassembly through direct observation of microtubules using dark-field microscopy. Tau increases the rate of polymerization, decreases the rate of transit into the shrinking phase (catastrophe), and inhibits the rate of depolymerization. Tau strongly suppresses the catastrophe rate, and its ability to do so is independent of its ability to increase the elongation rate. Thus, tau generates a partially stable but still dynamic state in microtubules. This state is perturbed by phosphorylation by MAP2 kinase, which affects all three activities by lowering the affinity of tau for the microtubule lattice."
21,Metabolite profiling identifies a key role for glycine in rapid cancer cell proliferation,2012,Mohit Jain and Roland Nilsson and Sonia Sharma and Nikhil Madhusudhan and Toshimori Kitami and Amanda L Souza and Ran Kafri and Marc W Kirschner and Clary B Clish and Vamsi K Mootha,"Metabolic reprogramming has been proposed to be a hallmark of cancer, yet a systematic characterization of the metabolic pathways active in transformed cells is currently lacking. Using mass spectrometry, we measured the consumption and release (CORE) profiles of 219 metabolites from media across the NCI-60 cancer cell lines, and integrated these data with a preexisting atlas of gene expression. This analysis identified glycine consumption and expression of the mitochondrial glycine biosynthetic pathway as strongly correlated with rates of proliferation across cancer cells. Antagonizing glycine uptake and its mitochondrial biosynthesis preferentially impaired rapidly proliferating cells. Moreover, higher expression of this pathway was associated with greater mortality in breast cancer patients. Increased reliance on glycine may represent a metabolic vulnerability for selectively targeting rapid cancer cell …"
22,"Purification of tau, a microtubule-associated protein that induces assembly of microtubules from purified tubulin",1977,Don W Cleveland and Shu-Ying Hwo and Marc W Kirschner,"Tau, a microtubule-associated protein which copurifies with tubulin through successive cycles of polymerization and depolymerization, has been isolated from tubulin by phosphocellulose chromatography and purified to near homogeneity. The purified protein is seen to migrate during electrophoresis on acrylamide gels as four closely spaced bands of apparent molecular weights between 55,000 and 62,000. Specific activity for induction of microtubule formation from purified tubulin has been assayed by quantitative electron microscopy and is seen to be enhanced three- to fourfold in the purified tau when compared with the unfractionated microtubule-associated proteins. Nearly 90% of available tubulin at 1 mg/ml is found to be polymerizable into microtubules with elevated levels of tau. Moreover, the critical concentration for polymerization of the reconstituted tau + tubulin system is seen to be a function of tau …"
23,"Geminin, an inhibitor of DNA replication, is degraded during mitosis",1998,Thomas J McGarry and Marc W Kirschner,"We describe a novel 25 kDa protein, geminin, which inhibits DNA replication and is degraded during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Geminin has a destruction box sequence and is ubiquitinated anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in vitro. In synchronized HeLa cells, geminin is absent during G1 phase, accumulates during S, G2, and M phases, and disappears at the time of the metaphase–anaphase transition. Geminin inhibits DNA replication by preventing the incorporation of MCM complex into prereplication complex (pre-RC). We propose that geminin inhibits DNA replication during S, G2, and M phases and that geminin destruction at the metaphase–anaphase transition permits replication in the succeeding cell cycle."
24,cdc25 is a specific tyrosine phosphatase that directly activates p34cdc2,1991,Jean Gautier and Mark J Solomon and Robert N Booher and J Fernando Bazan and Marc W Kirschner,"cdc25 controls the activity of the cyclin-p34cdc2 complex by regulating the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2. Drosophila cdc25 protein from two different expression systems activates inactive cyclin-p34cdc2 and induces M phase in Xenopus oocytes and egg extracts. We find that the cdc25 sequence shows weak but significant homology to a phylogenetically diverse group of protein tyrosine phosphatases. cdc25 itself is a very specific protein tyrosine phosphatase. Bacterially expressed cdc25 directly dephosphorylates bacterially expressed p34cdc2 on Tyr-15 in a minimal system devoid of eukaryotic cell components, but does not dephosphorylate other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at appreciable rates. In addition, mutations in the putative catalytic site abolish the in vivo activity of cdc25 and its phosphatase activity in vitro. Therefore, cdc25 is a specific protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates …"
25,Synergistic induction of mesoderm by FGF and TGF-β and the identification of an mRNA coding for FGF in the early Xenopus embryo,1987,David Kimelman and Marc Kirschner,"The primary patterning event in early vertebrate development is the formation of the mesoderm and its subsequent induction of the neural tube. Classic experiments suggest that the vegetal region signals the animal hemisphere to diverge from the pathway of forming ectoderm to form mesoderm such as muscle. Here we show that bovine basic FGF has a limited capacity to induce muscle actin expression in animal hemisphere cells. This level of expression can be raised to levels normally induced in the embryo by another mammalian growth factor, TGF-β, which by itself will not induce actin expression. We show that the Xenopus embryo contains an mRNA encoding a protein highly homologous to basic FGF. These results together with the identification of a maternal mRNA with strong homology to TGF-β, suggest that molecules closely related to FGF and TGF-β are the natural inducers of mesoderm in vertebrate …"
26,Identification of a vertebrate sister-chromatid separation inhibitor involved in transformation and tumorigenesis,1999,Hui Zou and Thomas J McGarry and Teresita Bernal and Marc W Kirschner,"A vertebrate securin (vSecurin) was identified on the basis of its biochemical analogy to the Pds1p protein of budding yeast and the Cut2p protein of fission yeast. The vSecurin protein bound to a vertebrate homolog of yeast separins Esp1p and Cut1p and was degraded by proteolysis mediated by an anaphase-promoting complex in a manner dependent on a destruction motif. Furthermore, expression of a stableXenopus securin mutant protein blocked sister-chromatid separation but did not block the embryonic cell cycle. The vSecurin proteins share extensive sequence similarity with each other but show no sequence similarity to either of their yeast counterparts. Human securin is identical to the product of the gene called pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG), which is overexpressed in some tumors and exhibits transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells. The oncogenic nature of increased expression of vSecurin …"
27,Anaphase initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by the APC-dependent degradation of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1p.,1996,Orna Cohen-Fix and Jan-Michael Peters and Marc W Kirschner and Doug Koshland,"Anaphase initiation has been postulated to be controlled through the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of an unknown inhibitor. This process involves the anaphase promoting complex (APC), a specific ubiquitin ligase that has been shown to be involved in mitotic cyclin degradation. Previous studies demonstrated that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pds1 protein is an anaphase inhibitor and suggested that it may be an APC target. Here we show that in yeast cells and in mitotic Xenopus extracts Pds1p is degraded in an APC-dependent manner. In addition, Pds1p is directly ubiquitinated by the Xenopus APC. In budding yeast Pds1p is degraded at the time of anaphase initiation and nondegradable derivatives of Pds1p inhibit the onset of anaphase. We conclude that Pds1p is an anaphase inhibitor whose APC-dependent degradation is required for the initiation of anaphase."
28,Mechanism of regulation of WAVE1-induced actin nucleation by Rac1 and Nck,2002,Sharon Eden and Rajat Rohatgi and Alexandre V Podtelejnikov and Matthias Mann and Marc W Kirschner,"Rac signalling to actin—a pathway that is thought to be mediated by the protein Scar/WAVE (WASP (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein)-family verprolin homologous protein)—has a principal role in cell motility. In an analogous pathway, direct interaction of Cdc42 with the related protein N-WASP stimulates actin polymerization 1. For the Rac–WAVE pathway, no such direct interaction has been identified. Here we report a mechanism by which Rac and the adapter protein Nck activate actin nucleation through WAVE1. WAVE1 exists in a heterotetrameric complex that includes orthologues of human PIR121 (p53-inducible messenger RNA with a relative molecular mass (M r) of 140,000), Nap125 (NCK-associated protein with an M r of 125,000) and HSPC300. Whereas recombinant WAVE1 is constitutively active, the WAVE1 complex is inactive. We therefore propose that Rac1 and Nck cause dissociation of the …"
29,Mitosis in transition,1994,Randall W King and Peter K Jackson and Marc W Kirschner,"In the last 5 years, many features of the control of the cell cycle have been clarified. The mitotic cycle is now understood as a biochemical pathway that generates from within the cell the orderly progressionof events concerned with duplication and division. The key component of this pathway is a mitotic regulator composed of the protein kinase catalytic subunit CdcP and its positive regulatory subunit, cyclin B. Together, these form mitosis-promoting factor (MPF), an activity that oscillates in the cell cycle and initiates mitosis. In the early cell cycles of amphibian and marine embryos, the activation and inactivation of MPF produce a rapid oscillation between mitosis and interphase. Since CdcP is constitutively present, it is the accumulation and periodic destruction of cyclin that determine the oscillation of MPF activity (Figure 1 A). In somatic cells, thesame components regulate mitosis, though additional controls regulate …"
30,The plausibility of life,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"This book is about the origins of novelty in evolution. The brain, the eye, and the hand are all anatomical forms that exquisitely serve function. They seem to reveal design. How could they have arisen? The vast diversity of organisms, from bacteria to fungi to plants and animals, all are of different design. How did they originate? Nothing in the inanimate world resembles them. All are novel. And yet novelty implies the creation of something from nothing—it has always defied explanation. When Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution by variation and selection, explaining selection was his great achievement. He could not explain variation. This was Darwin’s dilemma. He knew only that variation was indispensable as the raw material for selection to act on, and random with respect to the particular selection at work. Genetics provided important clues about the dependence of variation on genetic change and in …"
31,Physical and chemical properties of purified tau factor and the role of tau in microtubule assembly,1977,Don W Cleveland and Shu-Ying Hwo and Marc W Kirschner,"This paper describes the physical and chemical properties of purified tau, a protein which is associated with brain microtubules and which induces assembly of microtubules from tubulin. Purified tau is composed of four polypeptides which migrate at positions equivalent to molecular weights between 55,000 and 62,000 during electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels. These polypeptides are shown to be closely related by peptide mapping and by amnio acid analysis. A comparison by various techniques of the high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins with the tau polypeptides indicates no apparent relationship. Tau is found by analytical ultracentrifugation and by sedimentation equilibrium to have a sedimentation coefficient of 2.6 S and a native molecular weight of 57,000. Tau, therefore, must be highly asymmetric (an axial ratio of 20:1 using a prolate ellipsoid model), and yet …"
32,Sequence-specific and phosphorylation-dependent proline isomerization: a potential mitotic regulatory mechanism,1997,Michael B Yaffe and Mike Schutkowski and Minhui Shen and Xiao Zhen Zhou and P Todd Stukenberg and Jens-Ulrich Rahfeld and Jian Xu and Jian Kuang and Marc W Kirschner and Gunter Fischer and Lewis C Cantley and Kun Ping Lu,"Pin1 is an essential and conserved mitotic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that is distinct from members of two other families of conventional PPIases, cyclophilins and FKBPs (FK-506 binding proteins). In response to their phosphorylation during mitosis, Pin1 binds and regulates members of a highly conserved set of proteins that overlaps with antigens recognized by the mitosis-specific monoclonal antibody MPM-2. Pin1 is here shown to be a phosphorylation-dependent PPIase that specifically recognizes the phosphoserine-proline or phosphothreonine-proline bonds present in mitotic phosphoproteins. Both Pin1 and MPM-2 selected similar phosphorylated serine-proline–containing peptides, providing the basis for the specific interaction between Pin1 and MPM-2 antigens. Pin1 preferentially isomerized proline residues preceded by phosphorylated serine or threonine with up to 1300-fold selectivity compared …"
33,Microtubule assembly nucleated by isolated centrosomes,1984,Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,Microtubules are involved in the morphogenesis of most cells and are the structural basis of the mitotic spindle. We report here that purified centrosomes nucleate the assembly of microtubules with unusual dynamic properties. This may have important implications for the mechanism by which microtubule arrays are organized and stabilized in cells.
34,Homologies in both primary and secondary structure between nuclear envelope and intermediate filament proteins,1986,Frank D McKeon and Marc W Kirschner and Daniel Caput,"The A, B and C lamins are the major proteins of the nuclear envelope. The complete nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the A and C lamins shows that these proteins are identical except for their carboxy termini. The most prominent structural feature of both lamins is an α-helical region of repeating heptads of amino acids that shows striking homology with the entire family of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins. These features suggest that the nuclear envelope is made up of a network of coiled-coil polymers."
35,Cytoskeletal dynamics and nerve growth,1988,Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,"Nerve cells establish their connections by extending neuritic processes away from the rather fixed position of the cell body. In the case of axons, this growth can be extensive and the axon itself can contain more than 99% of the cytoplasmic volume (Heidenhain, 1911). There is abundant evidence that the cytoskeleton is the major internal structure defining the morphology of neurons (Letourneau, 1982; Lockerbie, 1987). We feel that an understanding of how the axonal cytoskeleton is assembled would largely explain the overall intracellular process of neuronal growth. According to this view, the information from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources that governs the direction and morphology of neuronal processes acts either directly or indirectly to influence the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton. While the correct spatial organization of membrane elements is obviously also important, we suggest that this is largely …"
36,The KEN box: an APC recognition signal distinct from the D box targeted by Cdh1,2000,Cathie M Pfleger and Marc W Kirschner,"The ordered progression through the cell cycle depends on regulating the abundance of several proteins through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Degradation is precisely timed and specific. One key component of the degradation system, the anaphase promoting complex (APC), is a ubiquitin protein ligase. It is activated both during mitosis and late in mitosis/G1, by the WD repeat proteins Cdc20 and Cdh1, respectively. These activators target distinct sets of substrates. Cdc20–APC requires a well-defined destruction box (D box), whereas Cdh1–APC confers a different and as yet unidentified specificity. We have determined the sequence specificity for Cdh1–APC using two assays, ubiquitination in a completely defined and purified system and degradation promoted by Cdh1–APC in Xenopus extracts. Cdc20 is itself a Cdh1–APC substrate. Vertebrate Cdc20 lacks a D box and therefore is recognized by Cdh1–APC …"
37,mik1 and wee1 cooperate in the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2,1991,Karen Lundgren and Nancy Walworth and Robert Booher and Marlene Dembski and Marc Kirschner and David Beach,"wee1 acts antagonistically to cdc25 in the tyrosine dephosphorylation and activation of cdc2, yet blochemical evidence suggests that wee1 is not required for tyrosine phosphorylation and its role is obscure. We show here that a related 66 kd kinase, called mik1, acts redundantly with wee1 in the negative regulation of cdc2 in S. pombe. A null allele of mik1 has no discernible phenotype, but a mik1 wee1 double mutant is hypermitotically lethal: all normal M phase checkpoints are bypassed, including the requirement for initiation of cell cycle “start,” completion of S phase, and function of the cdc25+ mitotic activator. In the absence of mik1 and wee1 activity, cdc2 rapidly loses phosphate on tyrosine, both in strains undergoing mitotic lethality and in those that are viable owing to a compensating mutation within cdc2. The data suggest that mik1 and wee1 act cooperatively on cdc2, either directly as the inhibitory tyrosine …"
38,Dominoes and clocks: the union of two views of the cell cycle,1989,Andrew W Murray and Marc W Kirschner,We review the recent advances in understanding transitions within the cell cycle. These have come from both genetic and biochemical approaches. We discuss the phylogenetic conservation of the mechanisms that induce mitosis and their implications for other transitions in the cell cycle.
39,Cyclin activation of p34cdc2,1990,Mark J Solomon and Michael Glotzer and Tina H Lee and Michel Philippe and Marc W Kirschner,"The gradual accumulation of cyclin in the frog egg induces an abrupt and concerted activation of p34cdc2 that initiates mitosis. Activation is delayed even after the accumulation of cyclin to a critical threshold concentration. We have reporduced these unusual kinetic properties of p34cdc2 activation in vitro using bacterially expressed cyclin proteins and extracts derived from Xenopus eggs. Abrupt activation follows a lag period, the length of which is independent of the concentration of cyclin. The threshold concentration of cyclin and the length of the lag period are regulated by INH, an inhibitor of MPF activation in oocytes recently identified as a type 2A protein phosphatase. Binding to cyclin induces both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation of the previously unphosphorylated p34cdc2, rendering it inactivated. The concerted transition into mitosis involves both a reduction in the rate of p34cdc2 phosphorylation on …"
40,Tau protein function in living cells.,1986,David G Drubin and Marc W Kirschner,"Tau protein from mammalian brain promotes microtubule polymerization in vitro and is induced during nerve cell differentiation. However, the effects of tau or any other microtubule-associated protein on tubulin assembly within cells are presently unknown. We have tested tau protein activity in vivo by microinjection into a cell type that has no endogenous tau protein. Immunofluorescence shows that tau protein microinjected into fibroblast cells associates specifically with microtubules. The injected tau protein increases tubulin polymerization and stabilizes microtubules against depolymerization. This increased polymerization does not, however, cause major changes in cell morphology or microtubule arrangement. Thus, tau protein acts in vivo primarily to induce tubulin assembly and stabilize microtubules, activities that may be necessary, but not sufficient, for neuronal morphogenesis."
41,Filament organization revealed in platinum replicas of freeze-dried cytoskeletons.,1980,J Eo Heuser and MeW Kirschner,"This report presents the appearance of rapidly frozen, freeze-dried cytoskeletons that have been rotary replicated with platinum and viewed in the transmission electron microscope. The resolution of this method is sufficient to visualize individual filaments in the cytoskeleton and to discriminate among actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments solely by their surface substructure. This identification has been confirmed by specific decoration with antibodies and selective extraction of individual filament types, and correlated with light microscope immunocytochemistry and gel electrophoresis patterns. The freeze-drying preserves a remarkable degree of three-dimensionality in the organization of these cytoskeletons. They look strikingly similar to the meshwork of strands or ""microtrabeculae"" seen in the cytoplasm of whole cells by high voltage electron microscopy, in that the filaments form a lattice of the same …"
42,The roles of APC and Axin derived from experimental and theoretical analysis of the Wnt pathway,2003,Ethan Lee and Adrian Salic and Roland Krüger and Reinhart Heinrich and Marc W Kirschner,"Wnt signaling plays an important role in both oncogenesis and development. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in stabilization of the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin. Recent studies have demonstrated that axin, which coordinates β-catenin degradation, is itself degraded. Although the key molecules required for transducing a Wnt signal have been identified, a quantitative understanding of this pathway has been lacking. We have developed a mathematical model for the canonical Wnt pathway that describes the interactions among the core components: Wnt, Frizzled, Dishevelled, GSK3β, APC, axin, β-catenin, and TCF. Using a system of differential equations, the model incorporates the kinetics of protein–protein interactions, protein synthesis/degradation, and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. We initially defined a reference state of kinetic, thermodynamic, and flux data from experiments using Xenopus extracts. Predictions based on the analysis of the reference state were used iteratively to develop a more refined model from which we analyzed the effects of prolonged and transient Wnt stimulation on β-catenin and axin turnover. We predict several unusual features of the Wnt pathway, some of which we tested experimentally. An insight from our model, which we confirmed experimentally, is that the two scaffold proteins axin and APC promote the formation of degradation complexes in very different ways. We can also explain the importance of axin degradation in amplifying and sharpening the Wnt signal, and we show that the dependence of axin degradation on APC is an essential part of an unappreciated regulatory loop that prevents …"
43,The primary structure and heterogeneity of tau protein from mouse brain,1988,Gloria Lee and Nicholas Cowan and Marc Kirschner,"Tau protein is a family of microtubule binding proteins, heterogeneous in molecular weight, that are induced during neurite outgrowth and are found prominently in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer9s disease. The predicted amino acid sequences of two forms of tau protein from mouse brain were determined from complementary DNA clones. These forms are identical in their amino-terminal sequences but differ in their carboxyl-terminal domains. Both proteins contain repeated sequences that may be tubulin binding sites. The sequence suggests that tau is an elongated molecule with no extensive alpha-helical or beta-sheet domains. These complementary DNAs should enable the study of various functional domains of tau and the study of tau expression in normal and pathological states."
44,"Mechanism of N-WASP activation by CDC42 and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate",2000,Rajat Rohatgi and Hsin-yi Henry Ho and Marc W Kirschner,"Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (N-WASP) transmits signals from Cdc42 to the nucleation of actin filaments by Arp2/3 complex. Although full-length N-WASP is a weak activator of Arp2/3 complex, its activity can be enhanced by upstream regulators such as Cdc42 and PI(4,5)P2. We dissected this activation reaction and found that the previously described physical interaction between the NH2-terminal domain and the COOH-terminal effector domain of N-WASP is a regulatory interaction because it can inhibit the actin nucleation activity of the effector domain by occluding the Arp2/3 binding site. This interaction between the NH2- and COOH termini must be intramolecular because in solution N-WASP is a monomer. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) influences the activity of N-WASP through a conserved basic sequence element located near the Cdc42 binding site rather than through the …"
45,Separate domains of p21 involved in the inhibition of Cdk kinase and PCNA,1995,Junjie Chen and Peter K Jackson and Marc W Kirschner and Anindya Dutta,"THE protein p21 (WAF1, CIP1 or sdil), induced by the tumour-suppressor protein p53, interacts with and inhibits two different targets essential for cell-cycle progression 1–8. One of these is the cyclin–Cdk family of kinases and the other is the essential DNA replication factor, proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We report here that separate domains of p21 are responsible for interacting with and inhibiting the two targets. An amino-terminal domain inhibits cyclin–Cdk kinases and a carboxyl-terminal domain inhibits PCNA. Using these separated domains, we have determined that p21 inhibits different biological systems through different targets. The PCNA-binding domain is sufficient for inhibition of DNA replication based on simian virus 40, whereas the Cdk2-binding domain is sufficient for inhibition of DNA replication based on Xenopus egg extract and for growth suppression in transformed human cells."
46,The checkpoint protein MAD2 and the mitotic regulator CDC20 form a ternary complex with the anaphase-promoting complex to control anaphase initiation,1998,Guowei Fang and Hongtao Yu and Marc W Kirschner,"The spindle assembly checkpoint mechanism delays anaphase initiation until all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate. Activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) by binding of CDC20 and CDH1 is required for exit from mitosis, and APC has been implicated as a target for the checkpoint intervention. We show that the human checkpoint protein hMAD2 prevents activation of APC by forming a hMAD2–CDC20–APC complex. When injected into Xenopus embryos, hMAD2 arrests cells at mitosis with an inactive APC. The recombinant hMAD2 protein exists in two-folded states: a tetramer and a monomer. Both the tetramer and the monomer bind to CDC20, but only the tetramer inhibits activation of APC and blocks cell cycle progression. Thus, hMAD2 binding is not sufficient for inhibition, and a change in hMAD2 structure may play a role in transducing the checkpoint signal. There are at least …"
47,ZNRF3 promotes Wnt receptor turnover in an R-spondin-sensitive manner,2012,Huai-Xiang Hao and Yang Xie and Yue Zhang and Olga Charlat and Emma Oster and Monika Avello and Hong Lei and Craig Mickanin and Dong Liu and Heinz Ruffner and Xiaohong Mao and Qicheng Ma and Raffaella Zamponi and Tewis Bouwmeester and Peter M Finan and Marc W Kirschner and Jeffery A Porter and Fabrizio C Serluca and Feng Cong,"R-spondin proteins strongly potentiate Wnt signalling and function as stem-cell growth factors. Despite the biological and therapeutic significance, the molecular mechanism of R-spondin action remains unclear. Here we show that the cell-surface transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) and its homologue ring finger 43 (RNF43) are negative feedback regulators of Wnt signalling. ZNRF3 is associated with the Wnt receptor complex, and inhibits Wnt signalling by promoting the turnover of frizzled and LRP6. Inhibition of ZNRF3 enhances Wnt/β-catenin signalling and disrupts Wnt/planar cell polarity signalling in vivo. Notably, R-spondin mimics ZNRF3 inhibition by increasing the membrane level of Wnt receptors. Mechanistically, R-spondin interacts with the extracellular domain of ZNRF3 and induces the association between ZNRF3 and LGR4, which results in membrane clearance of ZNRF3 …"
48,Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws,2014,Bruce Alberts and Marc W Kirschner and Shirley Tilghman and Harold Varmus,"The long-held but erroneous assumption of never-ending rapid growth in biomedical science has created an unsustainable hypercompetitive system that is discouraging even the most outstanding prospective students from entering our profession—and making it difficult for seasoned investigators to produce their best work. This is a recipe for long-term decline, and the problems cannot be solved with simplistic approaches. Instead, it is time to confront the dangers at hand and rethink some fundamental features of the US biomedical research ecosystem."
49,γ-Tubulin is a highly conserved component of the centrosome,1991,Tim Stearns and Louise Evans and Marc Kirschner,"We have cloned and characterized γ-tubulin genes from both X. laevis and S. pombe, and partial genes from maize, diatom, and a budding yeast. The proteins encoded by these genes are very similar to each other and to the original Aspergillus protein, indicating that γ-tubulins are an ubiquitous and highly conserved subfamily of the tubulin family. A null mutation of the S. pombe gene is lethal. γ-tubulin is a minor protein, present at less than 1 % the level of α- and β-tubulin, and is limited to the centrosome. In particular, γ-tubulin is associated with the pericentriolar material, the microtubule-nucleating material of the centrosome. γ-Tubulin remains associated with the centrosome when microtubules are depolymerized, suggesting that it is an integral component that might play a role in microtubule organization."
50,Tau protein binds to microtubules through a flexible array of distributed weak sites.,1991,KarenA Butner and Marc W Kirschner,"Tau protein plays a role in the extension and maintenance of neuronal processes through a direct association with microtubules. To characterize the nature of this association, we have synthesized a collection of tau protein fragments and studied their binding properties. The relatively weak affinity of tau protein for microtubules (approximately 10(-7) M) is concentrated in a large region containing three or four 18 amino acid repeated binding elements. These are separated by apparently flexible but less conserved linker sequences of 13-14 amino acids that do not bind. Within the repeats, the binding energy for microtubules is delocalized and derives from a series of weak interactions contributed by small groups of amino acids. These unusual characteristics suggest tau protein can assume multiple conformations and can pivot and perhaps migrate on the surface of the microtubule. The flexible structure of the tau …"
51,Cell cycle dynamics of an M-phase-specific cytoplasmic factor in Xenopus laevis oocytes and eggs.,1984,J Gerhart and M Wu and M Kirschner,"We have examined the regulation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity in the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles of Xenopus laevis eggs and oocytes. To this end, we developed a method for the small scale extraction of eggs and oocytes and measured MPF activity in extracts by a dilution end point assay. We find that in oocytes, MPF activity appears before germinal vesicle breakdown and then disappears rapidly at the end of the first meiotic cycle. In the second meiotic cycle, MPF reappears before second metaphase, when maturation arrests. Thus, MPF cycling coincides with the abbreviated cycles of meiosis. When oocytes are induced to mature by low levels of injected MPF, cycloheximide does not prevent the appearance of MPF at high levels in the first cycle. This amplification indicates that an MPF precursor is present in the oocyte and activated by posttranslational means, triggered by the low level of …"
52,"Pericentrin, a highly conserved centrosome protein involved in microtubule organization",1994,Stephen J Doxsey and Pascal Stein and Louise Evans and Patricia D Calarco and Marc Kirschner,"Antisera from scleroderma patients that react widely with centrosomes in plants and animals were used to isolate cDNAs encoding a novel centrosomal protein. The nucleotide sequence is consistent with a 7 kb mRNA and contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with a putative large coiled-coil domain flanked by noncoiled ends. Antisera recognize a 220 kd protein and stain centrosomes and acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers, where the protein is localized to the pericentriolar material (hence, the name pericentrin). Anti-pericentrin antibodies disrupt mitotic and meiotic divisions in vivo and block microtubule aster formation in Xenopus extracts, but do not block γ-tubulin assembly or microtubule nucleation from mature centrosomes. These results suggest that pericentrin is a conserved integral component of the filamentous matrix of the centrosome involved in the initial establishment of organized …"
53,Direct binding of CDC20 protein family members activates the anaphase-promoting complex in mitosis and G1,1998,Guowei Fang and Hongtao Yu and Marc W Kirschner,"Activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is required for anaphase initiation and for exit from mitosis. We show that APC is activated during mitosis and G1 by two regulatory factors, hCDC20 and hCDH1. These proteins directly bind to APC and activate its cyclin ubiquitination activity. hCDC20 confers a strict destruction-box (D-box) dependence on APC, while hCDH1 shows a much more relaxed specificity for the D-box. In HeLa cells, the protein levels of hCDC20 as well as its binding to APC peak in mitosis and decrease drastically at early G1. Thus, hCDC20 is the mitotic activator of APC and directs the degradation of substrates containing the D-box. The hCDH1 protein level remains constant during the cell cycle and may target specific substrates lacking the D-box in G1, such as polo-like kinase, for ubiquitination."
54,Tau consists of a set of proteins with repeated C-terminal microtubule-binding domains and variable N-terminal domains.,1989,Adolf Himmler and David Drechsel and Marc W Kirschner and David W Martin,"Tau proteins consist of a family of proteins, heterogeneous in size, which associate with microtubules in vivo and are induced during neurite outgrowth. In humans, tau is one of the major components of the pathognomonic neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer9s disease brain. Screening of a cDNA library prepared from bovine brain led to the isolation of several cDNA clones encoding tau proteins with different N termini and differing by insertions or deletions, suggesting differential splicing of the tau transcripts. One of the N-terminal domains and the repeated C-terminal domain of the encoded tau proteins are recognized by polyclonal antibodies to bovine tau. The bovine tau proteins are highly homologous to murine and human tau, especially within the repeated C-terminal domain. Compared with murine and human tau, bovine tau contains the insertion of three longer segments, one of which is an additional …"
55,A PtdInsP 3-and Rho GTPase-mediated positive feedback loop regulates neutrophil polarity,2002,Orion D Weiner and Paul O Neilsen and Glenn D Prestwich and Marc W Kirschner and Lewis C Cantley and Henry R Bourne,"When presented with a gradient of chemoattractant, many eukaryotic cells respond with polarized accumulation of the phospholipid PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P 3. This lipid asymmetry is one of the earliest readouts of polarity in neutrophils, Dictyostelium discoideum and fibroblasts. However, the mechanisms that regulate PtdInsP 3 polarization are not well understood. Using a cationic lipid shuttling system, we have delivered exogenous PtdInsP 3 to neutrophils. Exogenous PtdInsP 3 elicits accumulation of endogenous PtdInsP 3 in a positive feedback loop that requires endogenous phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases (PI (3) Ks) and Rho family GTPases. This feedback loop is important for establishing PtdInsP 3 polarity in response to both chemoattractant and to exogenous PtdInsP 3; it may function through a self-organizing pattern formation system. Emergent properties of positive and negative regulatory links between …"
57,Role of phosphorylation in p34cdc2 activation: identification of an activating kinase.,1992,Mark J Solomon and Tina Lee and Marc W Kirschner,"Phosphorylation of p34cdc2 can both positively and negatively regulate its kinase activity. We have mapped two phosphorylation sites in Xenopus p34cdc2 to Thr-14 and Tyr-15 within the putative ATP-binding region of p34cdc2. Mutation of these sites to Ala-14 and Phe-15 has no effect on the final histone H1 kinase activity of the cyclin/p34cdc2 complex. Phosphopeptide analysis shows that there is at least one more site of phosphorylation on p34cdc2. When Thr-161 is changed to Ala, two phosphopeptide spots disappear and it is no longer possible to activate the H1 kinase activity of p34cdc2. We suggest that Thr-161 is a third site of phosphorylation, which is required for kinase activity. All three phosphorylations are induced by cyclin. None of the phosphorylations appears to be required for binding to cyclin, as indicated by the ability of the triple mutant, Ala-14, Phe-15, Ala-161, to bind cyclin. The activating …"
58,Nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells involves the coordinate induction of microtubule assembly and assembly-promoting factors.,1985,David G Drubin and Stuart C Feinstein and Eric M Shooter and Marc W Kirschner,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) regulates the microtubule-dependent extension and maintenance of axons by some peripheral neurons. We show here that one effect of NGF is to promote microtubule assembly during neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Though NGF causes an increase in total tubulin levels, the formation of neurites and the assembly of microtubules follow a time course completely distinct from that of the tubulin induction. The increases in microtubule mass and neurite extension closely parallel 10- and 20-fold inductions of tau and MAP1, proteins shown previously to promote microtubule assembly in vitro. When NGF is removed from PC12 cells, neurites disappear, microtubule mass decreases, and both microtubule-associated proteins return to undifferentiated levels. These data suggest that the induction of tau and MAP1 in response to NGF promotes microtubule assembly and that these factors are …"
59,Dual inhibition of sister chromatid separation at metaphase,2001,Olaf Stemmann and Hui Zou and Scott A Gerber and Steven P Gygi and Marc W Kirschner,"Separation of sister chromatids in anaphase is mediated by separase, an endopeptidase that cleaves the chromosomal cohesin SCC1. Separase is inhibited by securin, which is degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we demonstrate that high CDC2 activity inhibits anaphase but not securin degradation. We show that separase is kept inactive under these conditions by a mechanism independent of binding to securin. Mutation of a single phosphorylation site on separase relieves the inhibition and rescues chromatid separation in extracts with high CDC2 activity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that, in intact cells, there is complete phosphorylation of this site in metaphase and significant dephosphorylation in anaphase. We propose that separase activation at the metaphase-anaphase transition requires the removal of both securin and an inhibitory phosphate."
60,In vitro reconstitution of centrosome assembly and function: the central role of γ-tubulin,1994,Tim Stearns and Marc Kirschner,"The centrosome nucleates microtubule polymerization, affecting microtubule number, polarity, and structure. We use an in vitro system based on extracts of Xenopus eggs to examine the role of γ-tubulin in centrosome assembly and function. γ-Tubulin is present in the cytoplasm of frog eggs and vertebrate somatic cells in a large ∼ 25S complex. The egg extracts assemble centrosomes around sperm centrioles. Formation of a centrosome in the extract requires both the γ-tubulin complex and ATP and can take place in the absence of microtubules. γ-Tubulin is not present on the sperm prior to incubation in extract, but is recrulted from the cytoplasm during centrosome assembly. The γ-tubulin complex also binds to microtubules, likely the minus end, independent of the centrosome. These results suggest that γ-tubulin is an essential component of the link between the centrosome and the microtubule, probably playing …"
61,Deuterostome phylogeny reveals monophyletic chordates and the new phylum Xenoturbellida,2006,Sarah J Bourlat and Thorhildur Juliusdottir and Christopher J Lowe and Robert Freeman and Jochanan Aronowicz and Mark Kirschner and Eric S Lander and Michael Thorndyke and Hiroaki Nakano and Andrea B Kohn and Andreas Heyland and Leonid L Moroz and Richard R Copley and Maximilian J Telford,"Deuterostomes comprise vertebrates, the related invertebrate chordates (tunicates and cephalochordates) and three other invertebrate taxa: hemichordates, echinoderms and Xenoturbella 1. The relationships between invertebrate and vertebrate deuterostomes are clearly important for understanding our own distant origins. Recent phylogenetic studies of chordate classes and a sea urchin have indicated that urochordates might be the closest invertebrate sister group of vertebrates, rather than cephalochordates, as traditionally believed 2, 3, 4, 5. More remarkable is the suggestion that cephalochordates are closer to echinoderms than to vertebrates and urochordates, meaning that chordates are paraphyletic 2. To study the relationships among all deuterostome groups, we have assembled an alignment of more than 35,000 homologous amino acids, including new data from a hemichordate, starfish and …"
62,Degradation of the SCF component Skp2 in cell-cycle phase G1 by the anaphase-promoting complex,2004,Wenyi Wei and Nagi G Ayad and Yong Wan and Guo-Jun Zhang and Marc W Kirschner and William G Kaelin,"Cell-cycle transitions are driven by waves of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of key cell-cycle regulators. SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) complexes and anaphase-promoting complexes (APC) represent two major classes of ubiquitin ligases whose activities are thought to regulate primarily the G1/S and metaphase/anaphase cell-cycle transitions, respectively 1, 2. The major target of the Skp1/Cul1/Skp2 (SCF SKP2) complex is thought to be the Cdk inhibitor p27 during S phase, whereas the principal targets for the APC are thought to be involved in chromatid separation (securin) and exit from mitosis (cyclin B). Although the role of the APC in mitosis is relatively clear, there is mounting evidence that APCs containing Cdh1 (APC CDH1) also have a function in the G1 phase of the cell cycle 2, 3. Here, we show that the F-box protein Skp2 is polyubiquitinated, and hence earmarked for destruction, by APC CDH1. As a …"
64,Identification of cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation sites on nuclear lamin C,1990,Gary E Ward and Marc W Kirschner,"The mechanism by which MPF induces nuclear lamin disassembly and nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis was studied in a frog egg extract in which the transition from interphase to mitosis can be induced by the addition of MPF. Bacterially expressed human nuclear lamin C, assembled in vitro into filaments, showed increased phosphorylation on specific sites in the extract in response to MPF. Phosphorylation was accompanied by disassembly of the lamin filaments. We determined the sequences of the sites phosphorylated both in the presence and absence of MPF. The sequence data suggest that multiple protein kinases act on the lamins, and S6 kinase II was identified as one potentially important lamin kinase."
65,"Nck and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate synergistically activate actin polymerization through the N-WASP-Arp2/3 pathway",2001,Rajat Rohatgi and Peter Nollau and Hsin-Yi Henry Ho and Marc W Kirschner and Bruce J Mayer,"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and its relative neural WASP (N-WASP) regulate the nucleation of actin filaments through their interaction with the Arp2/3 complex and are regulated in turn by binding to GTP-bound Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The Nck Src homology (SH) 2/3 adaptor binds via its SH3 domains to a proline-rich region on WASP and N-WASP and has been implicated in recruitment of these proteins to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. We show here that Nck SH3 domains dramatically stimulate the rate of nucleation of actin filaments by purified N-WASP in the presence of Arp2/3 in vitro. All three Nck SH3 domains are required for maximal activation. Nck-stimulated actin nucleation by N-WASP·Arp2/3 complexes is further stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, but not by GTP-Cdc42, suggesting that Nck and Cdc42 activate N-WASP by redundant …"
66,Toca-1 mediates Cdc42-dependent actin nucleation by activating the N-WASP-WIP complex,2004,Hsin-Yi Henry Ho and Rajat Rohatgi and Andres M Lebensohn and Le Ma and Jiaxu Li and Steven P Gygi and Marc W Kirschner,"An important signaling pathway to the actin cytoskeleton links the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 to the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex through N-WASP. Nevertheless, these previously identified components are not sufficient to mediate Cdc42-induced actin polymerization in a physiological context. In this paper, we describe the biochemical purification of Toca-1 (transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly) as an essential component of the Cdc42 pathway. Toca-1 binds both N-WASP and Cdc42 and is a member of the evolutionarily conserved PCH protein family. Toca-1 promotes actin nucleation by activating the N-WASP-WIP/CR16 complex, the predominant form of N-WASP in cells. Thus, the cooperative actions of two distinct Cdc42 effectors, the N-WASP-WIP complex and Toca-1, are required for Cdc42-induced actin assembly. These findings represent a significantly revised view of Cdc42-signaling and …"
67,Anteroposterior patterning in hemichordates and the origins of the chordate nervous system,2003,Christopher J Lowe and Mike Wu and Adrian Salic and Louise Evans and Eric Lander and Nicole Stange-Thomann and Christian E Gruber and John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner,"The chordate central nervous system has been hypothesized to originate from either a dorsal centralized, or a ventral centralized, or a noncentralized nervous system of a deuterostome ancestor. In an effort to resolve these issues, we examined the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii and studied the expression of orthologs of genes that are involved in patterning the chordate central nervous system. All 22 orthologs studied are expressed in the ectoderm in an anteroposterior arrangement nearly identical to that found in chordates. Domain topography is conserved between hemichordates and chordates despite the fact that hemichordates have a diffuse nerve net, whereas chordates have a centralized system. We propose that the deuterostome ancestor may have had a diffuse nervous system, which was later centralized during the evolution of the chordate lineage."
68,Properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wee1 and its differential regulation of p34CDC28 in response to G1 and G2 cyclins.,1993,Robert N Booher and Raymond J Deshaies and Marc W Kirschner,"Wee1 is a protein kinase that negatively regulates p34cdc2 kinase activity. We have identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wee1 homolog encoded by the SWE1 gene. SWE1 overexpression arrests cells in G2 with short spindles whereas deletion of SWE1 did not alter the cell cycle but did eliminate the G2 delay observed in mih1‐ mutants. Swe1 immunoprecipitates were capable of tyrosine phosphorylating and inactivating p34CDC28 complexed with Clb2, a G2‐type cyclin, but not p34CDC28 complexed with Cln2, a G1‐type cyclin, consistent with the inability of Swe1 overexpression to inhibit the G1/S transition. These results suggest that specific cyclin subunits target p34CDC28 for distinct regulatory controls which may be important for ensuring proper p34CDC28 function during the cell cycle."
69,Polewards chromosome movement driven by microtubule depolymerization in vitro,1988,Douglas E Koshland and TJ Mitchison and Marc W Kirschner,"We constructed complexes between isolated chromosomes and microtubules made from purified tubulin to study the movement of chromosomes towards the'minus' end of microtubules in vitro, a process analogous to the movement of chromosomes towards the pole of the spindle at anaphase of mitosis. Our results show that the energy for this movement is derived solely from microtubule depolymerization, and indicate that anaphase movement of chromosomes is both powered and regulated by microtubule depolymerization at the kinetochore."
70,Sites of microtubule assembly and disassembly in the mitotic spindle,1986,Tim Mitchison and Louise Evans and Eric Schulze and Marc Kirschner,"We have microinjected biotinylated tubulin into mitotic fibroblast cells to identify the sites in the spindle at which new subunits are incorporated into microtubules (MTs). Labeled subunits were visualized in the electron microscope using an antibody to biotin followed by a secondary antibody coupled to colloidal gold. Astral MTs incorporate labeled subunits very rapidly by elongation of existing MTs and by new nucleation from the centrosome. At a slower rate, kinetochore MTs incorporate subunits at the kinetochore progressively during metaphase, suggesting a slow poleward flux of subunits in the kinetochore fiber. When cells injected in metaphase were examined in anaphase, a significant fraction of kinetochore MTs was unlabeled, suggesting that depolymerization had occurred at the kinetochore concomitant with chromosome to pole movement. The existence of opposite fluxes at the kinetochore during …"
71,The essential mitotic peptidyl–prolyl isomerase Pin1 binds and regulates mitosis-specific phosphoproteins,1998,Minhui Shen and P Todd Stukenberg and Marc W Kirschner and Kun Ping Lu,"Phosphorylation of mitotic proteins on the Ser/Thr-Pro motifs has been shown to play an important role in regulating mitotic progression. Pin1 is a novel essential peptidyl–prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that inhibits entry into mitosis and is also required for proper progression through mitosis, but its substrate(s) and function(s) remain to be determined. Here we report that in both human cells and Xenopus extracts, Pin1 interacts directly with a subset of mitotic phosphoproteins on phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in a phosphorylation-dependent and mitosis-specific manner. Many of these Pin1-binding proteins are also recognized by the monoclonal antibody MPM-2, and they include the important mitotic regulators Cdc25, Myt1, Wee1, Plk1, and Cdc27. The importance of this Pin1 interaction was tested by constructing two Pin1 active site point mutants that fail to bind a phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motif in mitotic …"
72,Control of β-catenin stability: reconstitution of the cytoplasmic steps of the Wnt pathway in Xenopus egg extracts,2000,Adrian Salic and Ethan Lee and Leslie Mayer and Marc W Kirschner,"Regulation of β-catenin degradation by intracellular components of the wnt pathway was reconstituted in cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus eggs and embryos. The ubiquitin-dependent β-catenin degradation in extracts displays a biochemical requirement for axin, GSK3, and APC. Axin dramatically accelerates while dishevelled inhibits β-catenin turnover. Through another domain, dishevelled recruits GBP/Frat1 to the APC-axin-GSK3 complex. Our results confirm and extend models in which inhibition of GSK3 has two synergistic effects: (1) reduction of APC phosphorylation and loss of affinity for β-catenin and (2) reduction of β-catenin phosphorylation and consequent loss of its affinity for the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Dishevelled thus stabilizes β-catenin, which can dissociate from the APC/axin complex and participate in transcriptional activation."
73,The presence of fibroblast growth factor in the frog egg: its role as a natural mesoderm inducer,1988,David Kimelman and Judith A Abraham and Tapio Haaparanta and Thomas M Palisi and Marc W Kirschner,"A complementary DNA clone corresponding to a 4.2-kilobase transcript that is present in the Xenopus oocyte and newly transcribed in the neurula stages of development has been isolated. This messenger RNA encodes a 155-amino acid protein that is 84% identical to the human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). When expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, the Xenopus FGF induced mesoderm in animal cell blastomeres as measured by muscle actin expression. Immunoblots with an antibody to a Xenopus FGF peptide show that the oocyte and early embryo contain a store of the FGF polypeptide at high enough concentrations to induce mesoderm. The presence of FGF in the oocyte, together with the apparent lack of a secretory signal sequence in the protein, suggest that the regulation of mesoderm induction may involve novel mechanisms that occur after the translation of FGF."
74,Unpolymerized tubulin modulates the level of tubulin mRNAs,1981,Don W Cleveland and Margaret A Lopata and Peter Sherline and Marc W Kirschner,"Although numerous studies have suggested ways in which the assembly of cytoskeletal proteins can be regulated physiologically, less information has been generated on the regulation of the synthesis of these proteins. Ben-Ze'ev et al. recently suggested that the synthesis of tubulin in mouse 3T6 cells is affected by the state of assembly of microtubules. We have investigated the level at which this apparent modulation of tubulin synthesis takes place, using cloned cDNA probes for α- and β-tubulin mRNAs to measure the amounts of tubulin mRNAs combined with immunoprecipitation of tubulin to monitor the rate of protein synthesis. We have found that in many, but not all, cell types tubulin synthesis decreases very rapidly in response to microtubule inhibitors that increase the monomer pool. This decline in synthesis is associated with decline in the amounts of both α- and β-tubulin mRNAs. Kinetic studies of tubulin …"
75,The role of microtubule dynamics in growth cone motility and axonal growth.,1995,Elly Tanaka and Tran Ho and Marc W Kirschner,"The growth cone contains dynamic and relatively stable microtubule populations, whose function in motility and axonal growth is uncharacterized. We have used vinblastine at low doses to inhibit microtubule dynamics without appreciable depolymerization to probe the role of these dynamics in growth cone behavior. At doses of vinblastine that interfere only with dynamics, the forward and persistent movement of the growth cone is inhibited and the growth cone wanders without appreciable forward translocation; it quickly resumes forward growth after the vinblastine is washed out. Direct visualization of fluorescently tagged microtubules in these neurons shows that in the absence of dynamic microtubules, the remaining mass of polymer does not invade the peripheral lamella and does not undergo the usual cycle of bundling and splaying and the growth cone stops forward movement. These experiments argue for a …"
76,FGF signalling in the early specification of mesoderm in Xenopus,1993,Enrique Amaya and Pascal A Stein and Thomas J Musci and Marc W Kirschner,"We have examined the role of FGF signalling in the development of muscle and notochord and in the expression of early mesodermal markers in Xenopus embryos. Disruption of the FGF signalling pathway by expression of a dominant negative construct of the FGF receptor (XFD) generally results in gastrulation defects that are later evident in the formation of the trunk and tail, though head structures are formed nearly normally. These defects are reflected in the loss of notochord and muscle. Even in embryos that show mild defects and gastrulate properly, muscle formation is impaired, suggesting that morphogenesis and tissue differentiation each depend on FGF. The XFD protein inhibits the expression of the immediate early gene brachyury throughout the marginal zone, including the dorsal side; it does not, however, inhibit the dorsal lip marker goosecoid, which is expressed in the first involuting mesoderm at the …"
77,Microtubule behavior in the growth cones of living neurons during axon elongation.,1991,Elly M Tanaka and Marc W Kirschner,"To understand how microtubules are generated in the growth cone, we have imaged fluorescently tagged microtubules in living frog embryonic neurons. The neurons were labeled by injecting rhodamine-labeled tubulin into the fertilized egg and explanting the neurons from the neural tube. Microtubules extend deep into the growth cone periphery and adopt three characteristic distributions: (a) dispersed and splayed throughout much of the growth cone; (b) looped and apparently contorted by compression; and (c) bundled into tight arrays. These distributions interconvert on a time scale of several minutes and these interconversions are correlated with the behavior of the growth cone. We observed microtubule growth and shrinkage in growth cones, but are unable to determine their contribution to net assembly. However, translocation of polymer form the axon appears to be a major mechanism of generating new …"
78,The tumour suppressor RASSF1A regulates mitosis by inhibiting the APC–Cdc20 complex,2004,Min Sup Song and Su Jeong Song and Nagi G Ayad and Jin Sook Chang and Joo Hyun Lee and Hyun Kyung Hong and Ho Lee and Naeyun Choi and Jhingook Kim and Hojoong Kim and Jin Woo Kim and Eui-Ju Choi and Marc W Kirschner and Dae-Sik Lim,"The tumour suppressor gene RASSF1A is frequently silenced in lung cancer and other sporadic tumours as a result of hypermethylation of a CpG island in its promoter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. However, the precise mechanism by which RASSF1A functions in cell cycle regulation and tumour suppression has remained unknown. Here we show that RASSF1A regulates the stability of mitotic cyclins and the timing of mitotic progression. RASSF1A localizes to microtubules during interphase and to centrosomes and the spindle during mitosis. The overexpression of RASSF1A induced stabilization of mitotic cyclins and mitotic arrest at prometaphase. RASSF1A interacts with Cdc20, an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), resulting in the inhibition of APC activity. Although RASSF1A does not contribute to either the Mad2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint or the function of Emi1 (ref. 1), depletion of RASSF1A …"
79,Posttranslational modification and microtubule stability.,1987,Eric Schulze and David J Asai and Jeannette Chloe Bulinski and Marc Kirschner,"We have probed the relationship between tubulin posttranslational modification and microtubule stability, using a variation of the antibody-blocking technique. In human retinoblastoma cells we find that acetylated and detyrosinated microtubules represent congruent subsets of the cells' total microtubules. We also find that stable microtubules defined as those that had not undergone polymerization within 1 h after injection of biotin-tubulin were all posttranslationally modified; furthermore dynamic microtubules were all unmodified. We therefore conclude that in these cells the stable, acetylated, and detyrosinated microtubules represent the same subset of the cells' total network. Posttranslational modification, however, is not a prerequisite for microtubule stability and vice versa. Potorous tridactylis kidney cells have no detectable acetylated microtubules but do have a sizable subset of stable ones, and chick embryo …"
80,Nucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequences encoded by α and β tubulin mRNAs,1981,P Valenzuela and M Quiroga and J Zaldivar and WJ Rutter and MW Kirschner and DW Cleveland,"Most of the mRNA sequences coding for α and β tubulin in embryonic chick brain have been determined by sequencing of cloned cDNA copies of these mRNAs. From a 1,682-base pair cDNA sequence we have deduced the entire protein sequence for β tubulin. For α tubulin, all but about 38 N-terminal amino acids have been deduced from the cDNA sequence. Although tyrosine has previously been shown to be post-translationally added to the C-terminus of α tubulin by a specific ligase, we conclude that the primary post-translational event must be the removal, not the addition, of tyrosine because a terminal tyrosine is encoded by the mRNA."
81,A cytoplasmic clock with the same period as the division cycle in Xenopus eggs,1980,Koki Hara and Peter Tydeman and Marc Kirschner,"In most species the cell cycle is arrested in the unfertilized egg. After fertilization the cell cycle is reestablished and a rapid series of cleavages ensues. Preceding the first cleavage in Xenopus the egg undergoes a contraction of its cortex, called the ""surface contraction wave,"" which can be visualized by time-lapse cinematography. This wave of contraction is propagated in a circular manner from the animal pole to the equator. We have found that eggs prevented from cleaving by treatment with antimitotic drugs undergo a sequence of periodic surface contraction waves timed with the cleavage cycle in untreated eggs. In addition, artificially activated eggs, which fail to cleave presumably for lack of a functioning centriole, undergo the same periodic contractions. No nuclear material is required for the periodic waves because a separated egg fragment, produced by constricting a fertilized egg, still undergoes contraction …"
82,The incoherent feedforward loop can provide fold-change detection in gene regulation,2009,Lea Goentoro and Oren Shoval and Marc W Kirschner and Uri Alon,"Many sensory systems (e.g., vision and hearing) show a response that is proportional to the fold-change in the stimulus relative to the background, a feature related to Weber's Law. Recent experiments suggest such a fold-change detection feature in signaling systems in cells: a response that depends on the fold-change in the input signal, and not on its absolute level. It is therefore of interest to find molecular mechanisms of gene regulation that can provide such fold-change detection. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that fold-change detection can be generated by one of the most common network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent feedforward loop (I1-FFL), in which an activator regulates both a gene and a repressor of the gene. The fold-change detection feature of the I1-FFL applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude and duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical …"
83,A microtubule-associated protein from Xenopus eggs that specifically promotes assembly at the plus-end.,1987,David L Gard and Marc W Kirschner,"We have isolated a protein factor from Xenopus eggs that promotes microtubule assembly in vitro. Assembly promotion was associated with a 215-kD protein after a 1,000-3,000-fold enrichment of activity. The 215-kD protein, termed Xenopus microtubule assembly protein (XMAP), binds to microtubules with a stoichiometry of 0.06 mol/mol tubulin dimer. XMAP is immunologically distinct from the Xenopus homologues to mammalian brain microtubule-associated proteins; however, protein species immunologically related to XMAP with different molecular masses are found in Xenopus neuronal tissues and testis. XMAP is unusual in that it specifically promotes microtubule assembly at the plus-end. At a molar ratio of 0.01 mol XMAP/mol tubulin the assembly rate of the microtubule plus-end is accelerated 8-fold while the assembly rate of the minus-end is increased only 1.8-fold. Under these conditions XMAP promotes …"
84,Anaphase initiation is regulated by antagonistic ubiquitination and deubiquitination activities,2007,Frank Stegmeier and Michael Rape and Viji M Draviam and Grzegorz Nalepa and Mathew E Sowa and Xiaolu L Ang and E Robert Mcdonald Iii and Mamie Z Li and Gregory J Hannon and Peter K Sorger and Marc W Kirschner and J Wade Harper and Stephen J Elledge,"The spindle checkpoint prevents chromosome mis-segregation by delaying sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes have achieved bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. Its operation is essential for accurate chromosome segregation, whereas its dysregulation can contribute to birth defects and tumorigenesis. The target of the spindle checkpoint is the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase that promotes sister chromatid separation and progression to anaphase. Using a short hairpin RNA screen targeting components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in human cells, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme USP44 (ubiquitin-specific protease 44) as a critical regulator of the spindle checkpoint. USP44 is not required for the initial recognition of unattached kinetochores and the subsequent recruitment of checkpoint components. Instead, it prevents the premature activation of the APC …"
85,Cell growth and size homeostasis in proliferating animal cells,2009,Amit Tzur and Ran Kafri and Valerie S LeBleu and Galit Lahav and Marc W Kirschner,"A long-standing question in biology is whether there is an intrinsic mechanism for coordinating growth and the cell cycle in metazoan cells. We examined cell size distributions in populations of lymphoblasts and applied a mathematical analysis to calculate how growth rates vary with both cell size and the cell cycle. Our results show that growth rate is size-dependent throughout the cell cycle. After initial growth suppression, there is a rapid increase in growth rate during the G1 phase, followed by a period of constant exponential growth. The probability of cell division varies independently with cell size and cell age. We conclude that proliferating mammalian cells have an intrinsic mechanism that maintains cell size."
86,Ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex drives spindle checkpoint inactivation,2007,SK Reddy and M Rape and WA Margansky and MW Kirschner,"Eukaryotic cells rely on a surveillance mechanism known as the spindle checkpoint to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. The spindle checkpoint prevents sister chromatids from separating until all kinetochores achieve bipolar attachments to the mitotic spindle 1, 2, 3. Checkpoint proteins tightly inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase required for chromosome segregation and progression to anaphase. Unattached kinetochores promote the binding of checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1 to the APC-activator Cdc20, rendering it unable to activate APC. Once all kinetochores are properly attached, however, cells inactivate the checkpoint within minutes, allowing for the rapid and synchronous segregation of chromosomes 4. How cells switch from strong APC inhibition before kinetochore attachment to rapid APC activation once attachment is complete remains a mystery. Here we …"
87,Microtubule dynamics in interphase cells.,1986,Eric Schulze and Marc Kirschner,The sites of microtubule growth and the kinetics of elongation have been studied in vivo by microinjection of biotin-labeled tubulin and subsequent visualization with immunocytochemical probes. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrate that injected biotin-labeled subunits are incorporated into new segments of growth which are contiguous with unlabeled microtubules. Rapid incorporation occurs by elongation of existing microtubules and new nucleation off the centrosome. The growth rate is 3.6 micron/min and is independent of the concentration of injected labeled tubulin. This rate of incorporation together with turnover of existing microtubules leads to approximately 80% exchange in 15 min. The observed kinetics and pattern of microtubule turnover allow for an evaluation of the relevance of several in vitro models for steady-state dynamics to the in vivo situation. We have also observed …
88,An actin-based wave generator organizes cell motility,2007,Orion D Weiner and William A Marganski and Lani F Wu and Steven J Altschuler and Marc W Kirschner,"Although many of the regulators of actin assembly are known, we do not understand how these components act together to organize cell shape and movement. To address this question, we analyzed the spatial dynamics of a key actin regulator—the Scar/WAVE complex—which plays an important role in regulating cell shape in both metazoans and plants. We have recently discovered that the Hem-1/Nap1 component of the Scar/WAVE complex localizes to propagating waves that appear to organize the leading edge of a motile immune cell, the human neutrophil. Actin is both an output and input to the Scar/WAVE complex: the complex stimulates actin assembly, and actin polymer is also required to remove the complex from the membrane. These reciprocal interactions appear to generate propagated waves of actin nucleation that exhibit many of the properties of morphogenesis in motile cells, such as the ability of cells to flow around barriers and the intricate spatial organization of protrusion at the leading edge. We propose that cell motility results from the collective behavior of multiple self-organizing waves."
89,An antisense mRNA directs the covalent modification of the transcript encoding fibroblast growth factor in Xenopus oocytes,1989,David Kimelman and Marc W Kirschner,"The Xenopus oocyte contains three maternal basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) transcripts, the largest of which encodes the complete bFGF polypeptide. We show that the smallest transcript is transcribed in the opposite direction of the largest transcript and overlaps part of the coding sequence of bFGF. This antisense transcript encodes a highly conserved 25 kd polypeptide. In addition, the antisense transcript causes modification of the mRNA encoding bFGF during maturation of the oocyte, converting half of the adenine residues to inosine in the region of overlap between the sense and antisense transcripts. As this activity acts only on double-stranded RNA, the two mRNAs must be hybridized in the oocyte. We discuss a possible role for the antisense transcript in regulating the stability of the bFGF mRNA."
90,"Phosphorylation analysis by mass spectrometry: myths, facts, and the consequences for qualitative and quantitative measurements",2006,Hanno Steen and Judith A Jebanathirajah and John Rush and Nicolas Morrice and Marc W Kirschner,"The mass spectrometric analysis of protein phosphorylation is still far from being routine, and the outcomes thereof are often unsatisfying. Apart from the inherent problem of substoichiometric phosphorylation, three arguments as to why phosphorylation analysis is so problematic are often quoted, including (a) increased hydrophilicity of the phosphopeptide with a concomitant loss during the loading onto reversed-phase columns, (b) selective suppression of the ionization of phosphopeptides in the presence of unmodified peptides, and (c) lower ionization/detection efficiencies of phosphopeptides as compared with their unmodified cognates. Here we present the results of a study investigating the validity of these three arguments when using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We utilized a set of synthetic peptide/phosphopeptide pairs that were quantitated by amino acid analysis. Under the applied …"
91,Phosphorylation of microtubule‐associated protein tau: identification of the site for Ca2 (+)‐calmodulin dependent kinase and relationship with tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer …,1990,B Steiner and Eva-Maria Mandelkow and J Biernat and N Gustke and HE Meyer and B Schmidt and G Mieskes and HD Söling and D Drechsel and MW Kirschner,"The microtubule array in neuronal cells undergoes extensive growth, dynamics and rearrangements during neurite outgrowth. While little is known about how these changes are regulated, microtubule‐associated proteins (MAPs) including tau protein are likely to perform an important role. Tau is one of the MAPs in mammalian brain. When isolated it is usually a mixture of several isoforms containing between 341 and 441 residues that arise from alternative splicing. Tau can be phosphorylated by several protein kinases. Phosphorylation at certain sites results in major structural and functional changes, as seen by changes in electrophoretic mobility, interaction with microtubules, molecular length and elasticity. Here we show that the sites of phosphorylation by four kinases (PKA, PKC, CK and CaMK) all lie in the C‐terminal microtubule‐binding half of tau, but only the phosphorylation by CaM kinase shows the …"
92,Regulation of the cell cycle during early Xenopus development,1984,John W Newport and Marc W Kirschner,"Maturation-promoting factor (MPF) is a partially purified M-phase-specific activity that induces meiosis in frog oocytes and is detectable in mitotic lysates from cells of wide phylogenetic origins. We show here that without protein synthesis, addition and removal of MPF can drive the mitotic cycle in frog eggs, including nuclear membrane breakdown and reformation, chromosome condensation and decondensation, and suppression and initiation of DNA replication on endogenous DNA and on injected plasmid templates. We have also studied M-phase arrest induced by injection of unfertilized egg cytoplasm and show that this arrest blocks an endogenous cytoplasmic cell-cycle oscillator and causes the stabilization of MPF activity. The oscillator can be restarted by injection of Ca++, which causes chromosome decondensation, reinitiation of DNA replication, and loss of MPF activity. We have looked in more detail at …"
93,Using buoyant mass to measure the growth of single cells,2010,Michel Godin and Francisco Feijó Delgado and Sungmin Son and William H Grover and Andrea K Bryan and Amit Tzur and Paul Jorgensen and Kris Payer and Alan D Grossman and Marc W Kirschner and Scott R Manalis,"We used a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) combined with picoliter-scale microfluidic control to measure buoyant mass and determine the'instantaneous' growth rates of individual cells. The SMR measures mass with femtogram precision, allowing rapid determination of the growth rate in a fraction of a complete cell cycle. We found that for individual cells of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mouse lymphoblasts, heavier cells grew faster than lighter cells."
94,The meaning of systems biology,2005,Marc W Kirschner,"With the new excitement about systems biology, there is understandable interest in a definition. This has proven somewhat difficult. Scientific fields, like species, arise by descent with modification, so in their earliest forms even the founders of great dynasties are only marginally different than their sister fields and species. It is only in retrospect that we can recognize the significant founding events. Before embarking on a definition of systems biology, it may be worth remembering that confusion and controversy surrounded the introduction of the term “molecular biology,” with claims that it hardly differed from biochemistry. Yet in retrospect molecular biology was new and different. It introduced both new subject matter and new technological approaches, in addition to a new style.As a point of departure for systems biology, consider the quintessential experiment in the founding of molecular biology, the one gene one …"
95,The theory of facilitated variation,2007,John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner,"This theory concerns the means by which animals generate phenotypic variation from genetic change. Most anatomical and physiological traits that have evolved since the Cambrian are, we propose, the result of regulatory changes in the usage of various members of a large set of conserved core components that function in development and physiology. Genetic change of the DNA sequences for regulatory elements of DNA, RNAs, and proteins leads to heritable regulatory change, which specifies new combinations of core components, operating in new amounts and states at new times and places in the animal. These new configurations of components comprise new traits. The number and kinds of regulatory changes needed for viable phenotypic variation are determined by the properties of the developmental and physiological processes in which core components serve, in particular by the processes9 …"
96,Mutagenic analysis of the destruction signal of mitotic cyclins and structural characterization of ubiquitinated intermediates.,1996,Randall W King and M Glotzer and MW Kirschner,"Mitotic cyclins are abruptly degraded at the end of mitosis by a cell-cycle-regulated ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. To understand how cyclin is recognized for ubiquitin conjugation, we have performed a mutagenic analysis of the destruction signal of mitotic cyclins. We demonstrate that an N-terminal cyclin B segment as short as 27 residues, containing the 9-amino-acid destruction box, is sufficient to destabilize a heterologous protein in mitotic Xenopus extracts. Each of the three highly conserved residues of the cyclin B destruction box is essential for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Although an intact destruction box is essential for the degradation of both A- and B-type cyclins, we find that the Xenopus cyclin A1 destruction box cannot functionally substitute for its B-type counterpart, because it does not contain the highly conserved asparagine necessary for cyclin B proteolysis. Physical analysis …"
98,Centrosome development in early mouse embryos as defined by an autoantibody against pericentriolar material,1983,Patricia D Calarco-Gillam and Margaret C Siebert and Richard Hubble and Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,"A human autoantibody from a schleroderma patient was found to immunostain interphase and mitotic centrosomes in a variety of vertebrate cells. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry localized this antigen in dense pericentriolar material (PCM) surrounding the centrioles. The meiotic spindle of the mouse egg has no centriole but it exhibited a broad PCM band at each pole. This pattern was also found from the first through fourth mitotic divisions. During this time PCM was found assembled at a single locus in the cell and exclusively in mitotic cells; it was not observable in interphase cells. In the blastocyst, only polar trophoblast cells had characteristic centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. Results suggest PCM can exist, disperse, and reorganize during the cell cycle independently of the centriole, and its distribution in the embryo differs in cells having different fates."
99,Autonomous regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex couples mitosis to S-phase entry,2004,Michael Rape and Marc W Kirschner,"Oscillations in cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity drive the somatic cell cycle. After entry into mitosis, CDKs activate the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which then promotes cyclin degradation and mitotic exit. The re-accumulation of cyclin A causes the inactivation of APC and entry into S phase, but how cyclin A can accumulate in the presence of active APC has remained unclear. Here we show that, during G1, APC autonomously switches to a state permissive for cyclin A accumulation. Crucial to this transition is the APC Cdh1-dependent autoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) UbcH10. Because APC substrates inhibit the autoubiquitination of UbcH10, but not its E2 function, APC activity is maintained as long as G1 substrates are present. Thus, through UbcH10 degradation and cyclin A stabilization, APC autonomously downregulates its activity. This …"
100,The events of the midblastula transition in Xenopus are regulated by changes in the cell cycle,1987,David Kimelman and Marc Kirschner and Talma Scherson,"The midblastula transition (MBT) in Xenopus can be initiated prematurely by blocking the fundamental cell-cycle oscillator with cycloheximide, in which case motility and transcription are quickly initiated. Using various inhibitors of specific events of the cell cycle that do not inhibit the autonomous oscillator, we have shown that transcription is activated when DNA synthesis is interrupted and motility is activated when cell cleavage is inhibited. Furthermore, very low levels of transcription are found to occur before the MBT. These results demonstrate that the pre-MBT egg is fully competent for transcription and motility and suggest that different features of the rapid early cell cycle normally suppress these events."
101,Dorsoventral patterning in hemichordates: insights into early chordate evolution,2006,Christopher J Lowe and Mark Terasaki and Michael Wu and Robert M Freeman Jr and Linda Runft and Kristen Kwan and Saori Haigo and Jochanan Aronowicz and Eric Lander and Chris Gruber and Mark Smith and Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart,"We have compared the dorsoventral development of hemichordates and chordates to deduce the organization of their common ancestor, and hence to identify the evolutionary modifications of the chordate body axis after the lineages split. In the hemichordate embryo, genes encoding bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp) 2/4 and 5/8, as well as several genes for modulators of Bmp activity, are expressed in a thin stripe of ectoderm on one midline, historically called “dorsal.” On the opposite midline, the genes encoding Chordin and Anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein (Admp) are expressed. Thus, we find a Bmp-Chordin developmental axis preceding and underlying the anatomical dorsoventral axis of hemichordates, adding to the evidence from Drosophila and chordates that this axis may be at least as ancient as the first bilateral animals. Numerous genes encoding transcription factors and signaling ligands are expressed in the three germ layers of hemichordate embryos in distinct dorsoventral domains, such as pox neuro, pituitary homeobox, distalless, and tbx2/3 on the Bmp side and netrin, mnx, mox, and single-minded on the Chordin-Admp side. When we expose the embryo to excess Bmp protein, or when we deplete endogenous Bmp by small interfering RNA injections, these expression domains expand or contract, reflecting their activation or repression by Bmp, and the embryos develop as dorsalized or ventralized limit forms. Dorsoventral patterning is independent of anterior/posterior patterning, as in Drosophila but not chordates. Unlike both chordates and Drosophila, neural gene expression in hemichordates is not repressed by …"
102,Erk/Src phosphorylation of cortactin acts as a switch on-switch off mechanism that controls its ability to activate N-WASP,2004,Narcisa Martinez-Quiles and Hsin-Yi Henry Ho and Marc W Kirschner and Narayanaswamy Ramesh and Raif S Geha,"The Arp2/3 complex can be independently activated to initiate actin polymerization by the VCA domain of WASP family members and by the acidic N-terminal and F-actin-binding repeat region of cortactin, which possesses a C-terminal SH3 domain. Cortactin is a target for phosphorylation by Src tyrosine kinases and by serine/threonine kinases that include Erk. Here we demonstrate that cortactin binds N-WASP and WASP via its SH3 domain, induces in vitro N-WASP-mediated actin polymerization, and colocalizes with N-WASP and WASP at sites of active actin polymerization. Erk phosphorylation and a mimicking S405,418D double mutation enhanced cortactin binding and activation of N-WASP. In contrast, Src phosphorylation inhibited the ability of cortactin previously phosphorylated by Erk, and that of S405,418D double mutant cortactin, to bind and activate N-WASP. Furthermore, Y→D mutation of three tyrosine …"
103,"LIS1 regulates CNS lamination by interacting with mNudE, a central component of the centrosome",2000,Yuanyi Feng and Eric C Olson and P Todd Stukenberg and Lisa A Flanagan and Marc W Kirschner and Christopher A Walsh,"LIS1, a microtubule-associated protein, is required for neuronal migration, but the precise mechanism of LIS1 function is unknown. We identified a LIS1 interacting protein encoded by a mouse homolog of NUDE, a nuclear distribution gene in A. nidulans and a multicopy suppressor of the LIS1 homolog, NUDF. mNudE is located in the centrosome or microtubule organizing center (MTOC), and interacts with six different centrosomal proteins. Overexpression of mNudE dissociates γ-tubulin from the centrosome and disrupts microtubule organization. Missense mutations that disrupt LIS1 function block LIS1-mNudE binding. Moreover, misexpression of the LIS1 binding domain of mNudE in Xenopus embryos disrupts the architecture and lamination of the CNS. Thus, LIS1-mNudE interactions may regulate neuronal migration through dynamic reorganization of the MTOC."
104,Microtubule assembly and nucleation,1978,Marc W Kirschner,"This chapter presents recent studies on in vitro assembly, nucleation, and growth of microtubules along with the properties that shed light on their biological role. The biochemical study of structural proteins such as tubulin and actin is a new area. It has received a considerable amount of attention recently which, it is hoped, reflects progress. Despite the fact that actin is in general the most common cellular protein and that so much was known about it from studies of muscle, not until recently has its role in nonmuscle cells been appreciated. Tubulin, perhaps the second most common intracellular protein, was not described until the 1960s. Functional studies of tubulin assembly were not performed until 1972. The means of regulation and the principles of self-assembly are also presented in the chapter. It discusses the experiments that (1) emanated from the discovery of conditions for assembly of …"
105,The processivity of multiubiquitination by the APC determines the order of substrate degradation,2006,Michael Rape and Sashank K Reddy and Marc W Kirschner,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) coordinates mitosis and G1 by sequentially promoting the degradation of key cell-cycle regulators. Following the degradation of its substrates in G1, the APC catalyzes the autoubiquitination of its E2 UbcH10. This stabilizes cyclin A and allows it to inactivate APCCdh1. How the APC establishes this complex temporal sequence of ubiquitinations, referred to as substrate ordering, is not understood. Here we show that substrate ordering depends on the relative processivity of substrate multiubiquitination by the APC. Processive substrates obtain ubiquitin chains in a single APC binding event. The multiubiquitination of distributive substrates requires multiple rounds of APC binding, which render it sensitive to lower APC concentrations, competition by processive substrates, and deubiquitination. Consequently, more processive substrates are preferentially multiubiquitinated in …"
106,Identification of a cullin homology region in a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex,1998,Hongtao Yu and Jan-Michael Peters and Randall W King and Andrew M Page and Philip Hieter and Marc W Kirschner,"The anaphase-promoting complex is composed of eight protein subunits, including BimE (APC1), CDC27 (APC3), CDC16 (APC6), and CDC23 (APC8). The remaining four human APC subunits, APC2, APC4, APC5, and APC7, as well as human CDC23, were cloned. APC7 contains multiple copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat, similar to CDC16, CDC23, and CDC27. Whereas APC4 and APC5 share no similarity to proteins of known function, APC2 contains a region that is similar to a sequence in cullins, a family of proteins implicated in the ubiquitination of G1 phase cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The APC2 gene is essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and apc2 mutants arrest at metaphase and are defective in the degradation of Pds1p. APC2 and cullins may be distantly related members of a ubiquitin ligase family that targets cell cycle regulators for degradation."
107,"Evidence that fold-change, and not absolute level, of β-catenin dictates Wnt signaling",2009,Lea Goentoro and Marc W Kirschner,"In response to Wnt stimulation, β-catenin accumulates and activates target genes. Using modeling and experimental analysis, we found that the level of β-catenin is sensitive to perturbations in the pathway, such that cellular variation would be expected to alter the signaling outcome. One unusual parameter was robust: the fold-change in β-catenin level (post-Wnt/pre-Wnt). In Xenopus, dorsal-anterior development and target gene expression are robust to perturbations that alter the final level but leave the fold-change intact. These suggest, first, that despite cellular noise, the cell responds reliably to Wnt stimulation by maintaining a robust fold-change in β-catenin. Second, the transcriptional machinery downstream of the Wnt pathway does not simply read the β-catenin level after Wnt stimulation but computes fold-changes in β-catenin.

Microtubule capture and ATP-dependent translocation.,1985,TJ Mitchison and MW Kirschner,"We have studied the interaction of preformed microtubules (MTs) with the kinetochores of isolated chromosomes. This reaction, which we call MT capture, results in MTs becoming tightly bound to the kinetochore, with their ends capped against depolymerization. These observations, combined with MT dynamic instability, suggest a model for spindle morphogenesis. In addition, ATP appears to mobilize dynamic processes at captured MT ends. We used biotin-labeled MT seeds to follow assembly dynamics at the kinetochore. In the presence of ATP and unlabeled tubulin, labeled MT segments translocate away from the kinetochore by polymerization of subunits at the attached end. We have termed this reaction proximal assembly. Further studies demonstrated that translocation could be uncoupled from MT assembly. We suggest that the kinetochore contains an ATPase activity that walks along the MT lattice toward …"
109,Mitotic inactivation of a human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex,1998,Saïd Sif and P Todd Stukenberg and Marc W Kirschner and Robert E Kingston,"During mitosis, chromatin is condensed into mitotic chromosomes and transcription is inhibited, processes that might be opposed by the chromatin remodeling activity of the SWI/SNF complexes. Brg1 and hBrm, which are components of human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complexes, were recently shown to be phosphorylated during mitosis. This suggested that phosphorylation might be used as a switch to modulate SWI/SNF activity. Using an epitope-tag strategy, we have purified hSWI/SNF complexes at different stages of the cell cycle, and found that hSWI/SNF was inactive in cells blocked in G2–M. Mitotic hSWI/SNF contained Brg1 but not hBrm, and was phosphorylated on at least two subunits, hSWI3 and Brg1. In vitro, active hSWI/SNF from asynchronous cells can be phosphorylated and inactivated by ERK1, and reactivated by dephosphorylation. hSWI/SNF isolated as cells traversed mitosis regained activity when …"
110,Induction of early mitotic events in a cell-free system,1985,Ryn Miake-Lye and Marc W Kirschner,"Maturation promoting factor (MPF) has been shown to induce meiosis or mitosis when injected into Xenopus oocytes and embryos. We show here that early events of mitosis, chromatin condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown, are induced by MPF in somatic interphase nuclei incubated in a cell-free extract of Xenopus eggs. These events occur rapidly and synchronously in response to MPF and are reversed when MPF activity is diminished. Using this cell-free system, we show that major structural proteins of the nuclear lamina, lamins A and C, are hyperphosphorylated within 15 min after addition of MPF, followed by a gradual depolymerization of the nuclear lamina until the nuclear envelope breaks down 30 min later. These results show that MPF induces mitotic events in vitro, and that phosphorylation of the lamins precedes disassembly of the nuclear lamina and could act to trigger nuclear envelope …"
111,Cell-cycle-regulated activation of Akt kinase by phosphorylation at its carboxyl terminus,2014,Pengda Liu and Michael Begley and Wojciech Michowski and Hiroyuki Inuzuka and Miriam Ginzberg and Daming Gao and Peiling Tsou and Wenjian Gan and Antonella Papa and Byeong Mo Kim and Lixin Wan and Amrik Singh and Bo Zhai and Min Yuan and Zhiwei Wang and Steven P Gygi and Tae Ho Lee and Kun-Ping Lu and Alex Toker and Pier Paolo Pandolfi and John M Asara and Marc W Kirschner and Piotr Sicinski and Lewis Cantley and Wenyi Wei,"Akt, also known as protein kinase B, plays key roles in cell proliferation, survival and metabolism. Akt hyperactivation contributes to many pathophysiological conditions, including human cancers 1, 2, 3, and is closely associated with poor prognosis and chemo-or radiotherapeutic resistance 4. Phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (ref. 5) and T308 (ref. 6) activates Akt. However, it remains unclear whether further mechanisms account for full Akt activation, and whether Akt hyperactivation is linked to misregulated cell cycle progression, another cancer hallmark 7. Here we report that Akt activity fluctuates across the cell cycle, mirroring cyclin A expression. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of S477 and T479 at the Akt extreme carboxy terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A or mTORC2, under distinct physiological conditions, promotes Akt activation through facilitating, or functionally compensating for, S473 …"
112,The dynamics of gene expression in vertebrate embryogenesis at single-cell resolution,2018,James A Briggs and Caleb Weinreb and Daniel E Wagner and Sean Megason and Leonid Peshkin and Marc W Kirschner and Allon M Klein,"Metazoan development represents a big jump in complexity compared with unicellular life in two aspects: cell-type differentiation and cell spatial organization. In vertebrate embryos, many distinct cell types appear within just a single day of life after fertilization. Studying the developmental dynamics of all embryonic cell types is complicated by factors such as the speed of early development, complex cellular spatial organization, and scarcity of raw material for conventional analysis. Genetics and experimental embryology have clarified major transcription factors and secreted signaling molecules involved in the specification of early lineages. However, development involves parallel alterations in many cellular circuits, not just a few well-described factors.We recently developed a microfluidics-based single-cell RNA sequencing method capable of efficiently profiling tens of thousands of …"
113,Spontaneous formation of nucleus-like structures around bacteriophage DNA microinjected into Xenopus eggs,1983,Douglass J Forbes and Marc W Kirschner and John W Newport,"We have found that injection of bacteriophage λ DNA into unfertilized Xenopus eggs causes the assembly around the DNA of structures resembling typical eucaryotic cell nuclei. These spherical structures begin to form 60–90 min after injection. They contain X DNA and are bounded by a phase-dense envelope. Immunofluorescent staining of the λ-DNA-containing structures with anti-lamin antibody reveals the presence of the lamin nuclear proteins at the periphery of the structure, a pattern identical to that of embryonic nuclei. Electron microscopy reveals that the injected DNA is surrounded by a double bilayer nuclear membrane containing nuclear pore complexes. The “nuclei” containing λ DNA respond to modulators of the Xenopus cell cycle in a manner that mimics the response of embryonic nuclei to these modulators during mitosis. These results suggest that nuclear reassembly and breakdown occur …"
114,Bioenergetics and kinetics of microtubule and actin filament assembly–disassembly,1982,Terrell L Hill and Marc W Kirschner,"This chapter discusses the bioenergetics and kinetics of microtubule and actin filament assembly–disassembly. The chapter focuses on an important property of actin filaments and microtubules: their utilization of the free energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. To interpret the function of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis, a number of other properties are considered that include the structural and kinetic polarity of the filaments; their interaction at the ends with specific components; and the action of forces on the filaments. The important boundary conditions, such as forces acting in various ways on the filaments and the effect of materials that interact at the ends of filaments, are discussed in the chapter. The chapter also focuses on the biological implications of these properties in terms of capacity to do work, regulate length, and regulate spatial …"
115,"Geminin, a neuralizing molecule that demarcates the future neural plate at the onset of gastrulation",1998,Kristen L Kroll and Adrian N Salic and Louise M Evans and Marc W Kirschner,"In an expression cloning screen in Xenopus embryos, we identified a gene that when overexpressed expanded the neural plate at the expense of adjacent neural crest and epidermis. This gene, which we named geminin, had no sequence similarity to known gene families. We later discovered that geminin9s neuralizing domain was part of a bifunctional protein whose C-terminal coiled-coil domain may play a role in regulating DNA replication. We report here on the neuralizing function of geminin. The localization, effect of misexpression and activity of a dominant negative geminin suggest that the product of this gene has an essential early role in specifying neural cell fate in vertebrates. Maternal geminin mRNA is found throughout the animal hemisphere from oocyte through late blastula. At the early gastrula, however, expression is restricted to a dorsal ectodermal territory that prefigures the neural plate …"
116,Influence of the centrosome on the structure of nucleated microtubules.,1985,Louise Evans and Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,"The capacity of the centrosome to influence the lattice structure of nucleated microtubules was studied in vitro. Brain microtubules self-assembled to give predominantly (98%) 14-protofilament microtubules. However, under exactly the same conditions of assembly they grew off of purified centrosomes from neuroblastoma cells to give mostly (82%) 13-protofilament microtubules. Thus, the nucleation sites on the centrosome constrained the microtubule lattice to yield the number of protofilaments usually found in vivo."
117,Substrate recognition by the Cdc20 and Cdh1 components of the anaphase-promoting complex,2001,Cathie M Pfleger and Ethan Lee and Marc W Kirschner,"The specificity of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation with regards to the selection of substrates to be polyubiquitinated has only been determined rather recently. Substrate targeting by the N-end rule and HECT (homology to E6AP carboxylterminus) domain ubiquitin ligases occurs through substrate-specific binding domains. In contrast, the SCF complex recruits substrates through a substrate adaptor protein, the F-box subunit. Despite evidence showing that Cdc20 and Cdh1 bind and activate the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in a substrate-specific manner, there is no evidence that the activating protein and substrate interact directly; hence, no clear model exists for the mechanism of APC activation or recruitment of substrates. We show here that the activators Cdc20 and Cdh1 can associate with substrates via their N termini. In the absence of APC, Cdc20 and Cdh1 bind substrates reflecting Cdc20–APC …"
118,Dynamic and stable populations of microtubules in cells.,1987,Eric Schulze and Marc Kirschner,"Using a new immunocytochemical technique, we have visualized the spatial arrangement of those microtubules in cells that are stable to biotin-tubulin incorporation after microinjection. Cells fixed at various periods of time after injection were exposed to antibody to biotinylated tubulin and several layers of secondary antibodies; these layers prevented reaction of biotin-containing microtubules with antitubulin antibodies. The microtubules that had not incorporated biotin-tubulin could then be stained with anti-tubulin and a fluorescent secondary antibody. In BSC1 cells, most microtubules in the cell exchange with a half-time of 10 min. A separate population of microtubules can be detected, using the above techniques, that are stable to exchange for 1 h or more; these have a characteristic pericentrosomal spatial arrangement as compared to the majority of dynamic microtubules. Unlike the dynamic microtubules, most …"
119,Molecular “vitalism”,2000,Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart and Tim Mitchison,"In the early nineteenth century, views on the nature of living organisms were broadly divided into two categories, chemical and vitalist. The former held that life was a consequence of complex, but ultimately knowable physicochemical processes, while the latter posited some nonnatural, perhaps unknowable, properties of living systems. Vitalism was progressively undermined by Wohler's synthesis of urea (1828) and by Pasteur's inability to demonstrate spontaneous generation (1862), as well as by Darwin's Origin of Species (1859) and Virchow's cell theory (1855). By the turn of the twentieth century the remarkable properties of living systems were more evident than ever, but vitalism was no longer invoked to explain them. The modern scientific quest for the chemical basis of life had begun in earnest. Although heredity was known as an important property of living organisms, investigations of the chemical basis of …"
120,A polymer-dependent increase in phosphorylation of beta-tubulin accompanies differentiation of a mouse neuroblastoma cell line.,1985,David L Gard and Marc W Kirschner,"We have examined the phosphorylation of cellular microtubule proteins during differentiation and neurite outgrowth in N115 mouse neuroblastoma cells. N115 differentiation, induced by serum withdrawal, is accompanied by a fourfold increase in phosphorylation of a 54,000-mol-wt protein identified as a specific isoform of beta-tubulin by SDS PAGE, two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS PAGE, and immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antiserum. Isoelectric focusing/SDS PAGE of [35S]methionine-labeled cell extracts revealed that the phosphorylated isoform of beta-tubulin, termed beta 2, is one of three isoforms detected in differentiated N115 cells, and is diminished in amounts in the undifferentiated cells. Taxol, a drug which promotes microtubule assembly, stimulates phosphorylation of beta-tubulin in both differentiated and undifferentiated N115 cells. In contrast, treatment of differentiated cells …"
121,Ubiquitination of the G1 cyclin Cln2p by a Cdc34p‐dependent pathway.,1995,Raymond J Deshaies and Vincent Chau and Marc Kirschner,"Recombinant G1 cyclin Cln2p can bind to and stimulate the protein kinase activity of p34CDC28 (Cdc28p) in an extract derived from cyclin‐depleted and G1‐arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Upon activating Cdc28p, Cln2p is extensively phosphorylated and conjugated with multiubiquitin chains. Ubiquitination of Cln2p in vitro requires the Cdc34p ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme, Cdc28p, protein phosphorylation and unidentified factors in yeast extract. Ubiquitination of Cln2p by Cdc34p contributes to the instability of Cln2p in vivo, as the rate of Cln2p degradation is reduced in cdc34ts cells. These results provide a molecular framework for G1 cyclin instability and suggest that a multicomponent, regulated pathway specifies the selective ubiquitination of G1 cyclins."
122,Systematic identification of mitotic phosphoproteins,1997,P Todd Stukenberg and Kevin D Lustig and Thomas J McGarry and Randall W King and Jian Kuang and Marc W Kirschner,"Background: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are thought to initiate and coordinate cell division processes by sequentially phosphorylating key targets; in most cases these substrates remain unidentified.Results: Using a screen that scores for phosphorylation of proteins, which were translated from pools of cDNA plasmids in vitro, by either phosphoepitope antibody recognition or electrophoretic mobility shifts, we have identified 20 mitotically phosphorylated proteins from Xenopus embryos, 15 of which have sequence similarity to other proteins. Of these proteins, five have previously been shown to be phosphorylated during mitosis (epithelial-microtubule associated protein-115, Oct91, Elongation factor 1γ, BRG1 and Ribosomal protein L18A), five are related to proteins postulated to have roles in mitosis (epithelial-microtubule associated protein-115, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc5, innercentrosome protein …"
123,Implications of treadmilling for the stability and polarity of actin and tubulin polymers in vivo.,1980,Marc W Kirschner,"In this report, we examine how the cell can selectively stabilize anchored filaments and suppress spontaneous filament assembly. Because microtubules and actin filaments have an organized distribution in cells, the cell must have a mechanism for suppressing spontaneous and random polymerization. Though the mechanism for suppressing spontaneous polymerization is unknown, an unusual property of these filaments has been demonstrated recently, i.e., under steady-stae conditions, in vitro actin filaments and microtubules can exhibit a flux of subunits through the polymers called ""treadmilling."" In vivo, however, most, if not all, of these polymers are attached at one end to specific structures and treadmilling should not occur. The function of treadmilling in vivo is, therefore, unclear at present. However, as shown here, the same physicochemical property of coupling assembly to ATP or GTP hydrolysis that leads …"
125,"INH, a negative regulator of MPF, is a form of protein phosphatase 2A",1991,Tina H Lee and Mark J Solomon and Marc C Mumby and Marc W Kirschner,"MPF, a protein kinase complex consisting of cyclin and p34cdc2 subunits, promotes the G2 to M phase transition in eukaryotic cells. The pathway of activation and inactivation of MPF is not well understood, although there is strong evidence that removal of phosphate from a tyrosine residue on p34cdc2 is part of the activation process. INH was originally identified as an activity that could inhibit the posttranslational activation of a latent form of MPF, called pre-MPF, in immature (G2 phase-arrested) Xenopus oocytes. We have purified INH and demonstrated that it is a form of protein phosphatase 2A. Both INH and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A can directly inactivate an isolated p34cdc2-cyclin complex. Both cyclin and p34cdc2 become dephosphorylated; the rate of inactivation closely parallels the removal of phosphate from a specific site on p34cdc2. We propose that INH opposes MPF activation by …"
126,Early events in DNA replication require cyclin E and are blocked by p21CIP1.,1995,Peter K Jackson and Stephane Chevalier and Michel Philippe and Marc W Kirschner,"Using immunodepletion of cyclin E and the inhibitor protein p21WAF/CIP1, we demonstrate that the cyclin E protein, in association with Cdk2, is required for the elongation phase of replication on single-stranded substrates. Although cyclin E/Cdk2 is likely to be the major target by which p21 inhibits the initiation of sperm DNA replication, p21 can inhibit single-stranded replication through a mechanism dependent on PCNA. While the cyclin E/Cdk2 complex appears to have a role in the initiation of DNA replication, another Cdk kinase, possibly cyclin A/Cdk, may be involved in a later step controlling the switch from initiation to elongation. The provision of a large maternal pool of cyclin E protein shows that regulators of replication are constitutively present, which explains the lack of a protein synthesis requirement for replication in the early embryonic cell cycle."
128,Identification of a new uracil-DNA glycosylase family by expression cloning using synthetic inhibitors,1999,Karl A Haushalter and P Todd Stukenberg and Marc W Kirschner and Gregory L Verdine,"Background: The cellular environment exposes DNA to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous reactive species that can damage DNA, thereby leading to genetic mutations. DNA glycosylases protect the integrity of the genome by catalyzing the first step in the base excision–repair of lesions in DNA.Results: Here, we report a strategy to conduct genome-wide screening for expressed DNA glycosylases, based on their ability to bind to a library of four synthetic inhibitors that target the enzyme's active site. These inhibitors, used in conjunction with the in vitro expression cloning procedure, led to the identification of novel Xenopus and human proteins, xSMUG1 and hSMUG1, respectively, that efficiently excise uracil residues from DNA. Despite a lack of statistically significant overall sequence similarity to the two established classes of uracil-DNA glycosylases, the SMUG1 enzymes contain motifs that are …"
129,Cdc42 is required for PIP2-induced actin polymerization and early development but not for cell viability,2000,F Chen and L Ma and MC Parrini and X Mao and M Lopez and C Wu and PW Marks and L Davidson and DJ Kwiatkowski and T Kirchhausen and SH Orkin and FS Rosen and BJ Mayer and MW Kirschner and FW Alt,"Background: Cdc42 and other Rho GTPases are conserved from yeast to humans and are thought to regulate multiple cellular functions by inducing coordinated changes in actin reorganization and by activating signaling pathways leading to specific gene expression. Direct evidence implicating upstream signals and components that regulate Cdc42 activity or for required roles of Cdc42 in activation of downstream protein kinase signaling cascades is minimal, however. Also, whereas genetic analyses have shown that Cdc42 is essential for cell viability in yeast, its potential roles in the growth and development of mammalian cells have not been directly assessed.Results: To elucidate potential functions of Cdc42 mammalian cells, we used gene-targeted mutation to inactivate Cdc42 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and in the mouse germline. Surprisingly, Cdc42-deficient ES cells exhibited normal proliferation …"
130,A noncanonical Frizzled2 pathway regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis,2014,Taranjit S Gujral and Marina Chan and Leonid Peshkin and Peter K Sorger and Marc W Kirschner and Gavin MacBeath,"Wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development, and genetic aberrations in this network have been broadly implicated in colorectal cancer. We find that the Wnt receptor Frizzled2 (Fzd2) and its ligands Wnt5a/b are elevated in metastatic liver, lung, colon, and breast cancer cell lines and in high-grade tumors and that their expression correlates with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Pharmacologic and genetic perturbations reveal that Fzd2 drives EMT and cell migration through a previously unrecognized, noncanonical pathway that includes Fyn and Stat3. A gene signature regulated by this pathway predicts metastasis and overall survival in patients. We have developed an antibody to Fzd2 that reduces cell migration and invasion and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in xenografts. We propose that targeting this pathway could provide benefit for patients with tumors expressing …"
131,Purification and architecture of the ubiquitous Wave complex,2004,Alexis Gautreau and H Ho Hsin-yi and Jiaxu Li and Hanno Steen and Steven P Gygi and Marc W Kirschner,"The Wave proteins are major activators of the Arp2/3 complex. The ubiquitous Wave-2 is required for actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells. Here we purify Wave-2 from HeLa cells. Five proteins, Sra, Nap, Wave-2, Abi, and Hspc, are copurified, indicating that they form a tight complex. These proteins are only present in the complexed form, with the exception of Hspc, which displays a free pool. We reconstitute the Wave-2 complex by cotranslating in vitro the five subunits and use this system together with specific immunoprecipitations to study the molecular architecture of the complex. The complex is organized around a core of Nap and Abi. Sra is a peripheral subunit recruited on the Nap side, whereas the Wave and Hspc subunits are recruited on the Abi side of the core."
132,"Interconversion of metaphase and interphase microtubule arrays, as studied by the injection of centrosomes and nuclei into Xenopus eggs.",1984,Eric Karsenti and John Newport and Richard Hubble and Marc Kirschner,"We have designed experiments that distinguish centrosomal , nuclear, and cytoplasmic contributions to the assembly of the mitotic spindle. Mammalian centrosomes acting as microtubule-organizing centers were assayed by injection into Xenopus eggs either in a metaphase or an interphase state. Injection of partially purified centrosomes into interphase eggs induced the formation of extensive asters. Although centrosomes injected into unactivated eggs (metaphase) did not form asters, inhibition of centrosomes is not irreversible in metaphase cytoplasm: subsequent activation caused aster formation. When cytoskeletons containing nuclei and centrosomes were injected into the metaphase cytoplasm, they produced spindle-like structures with clearly defined poles. Electron microscopy revealed centrioles with nucleated microtubules. However, injection of nuclei prepared from karyoplasts that were devoid of …"
133,Stable isotope-free relative and absolute quantitation of protein phosphorylation stoichiometry by MS,2005,Hanno Steen and Judith A Jebanathirajah and Michael Springer and Marc W Kirschner,"Qualitative and quantitative information are crucial to a detailed understanding of the function of protein phosphorylation. MS is now becoming a quantitative approach to analyze protein phosphorylation. All methods that have been described either require the elaborate/expensive use of stable isotopes to compare a limited number of samples or do not provide phosphorylation stoichiometries. Here, we present stable isotope-free MS strategies that allow relative and absolute quantitation of phosphorylation stoichiometries. By using the developed methods, we can normalize to robustly account for run-to-run variations and variations in amounts of starting material. This procedure monitors the unmodified proteolytic peptides derived from the protein of interest and identifies peptides that are suitable for normalization purposes. Also, we can determine changes in phosphorylation stoichiometry by monitoring the …"
134,The Arp2/3 complex mediates actin polymerization induced by the small GTP-binding protein Cdc42,1998,LE Ma and Rajat Rohatgi and Marc W Kirschner,"The small GTP-binding protein Cdc42 is thought to induce filopodium formation by regulating actin polymerization at the cell cortex. Although several Cdc42-binding proteins have been identified and some of them have been implicated in filopodium formation, the precise role of Cdc42 in modulating actin polymerization has not been defined. To understand the biochemical pathways that link Cdc42 to the actin cytoskeleton, we have reconstituted Cdc42-induced actin polymerization in Xenopus egg extracts. Using this cell-free system, we have developed a rapid and specific assay that has allowed us to fractionate the extract and isolate factors involved in this activity. We report here that at least two biochemically distinct components are required, based on their chromatographic behavior and affinity for Cdc42. One component is purified to homogeneity and is identified as the Arp2/3 complex, a protein complex that …"
135,Identification of BIME as a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex,1996,Jan-Michael Peters and Randall W King and Christer Höög and Marc W Kirschner,"The initiation of anaphase and exit from mitosis require the activation of a proteolytic system that ubiquitinates and degrades cyclin B. The regulated component of this system is a large ubiquitin ligase complex, termed the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome. Purified Xenopus laevis APC was found to be composed of eight major subunits, at least four of which became phosphorylated in mitosis. In addition to CDC27, CDC16, and CDC23, APC contained a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans BIME, a protein essential for anaphase. Because mutation of bimE can bypass the interphase arrest induced by either nimA mutation or unreplicated DNA, it appears that ubiquitination catalyzed by APC may also negatively regulate entry into mitosis."
136,Microtubules from mammalian brain: some properties of their depolymerization products and a proposed mechanism of assembly and disassembly,1974,Marc W Kirschner and Robley C Williams and Murray Weingarten and John C Gerhart,"Depolymerization products of purified microtubules from porcine brain were examined by sedimentation analysis and electron microscopy. The complete depolymerization mixture exhibited 36S and 6S components in concentration-dependent equilibrium, whether depolymerization was caused by low temperature or by calcium ion. These components were recognized by electron microscopy as spirals and rings, and small particles. Agarose column chromatography yielded two major fractions, a leading one comprising mostly 36S and some 6S material and a trailing one of solely 6S material. The latter had high specific colchicine-binding activity and no tendency to polymerize. For the leading peak material these properties were the converse. It is proposed that tubulin molecules (of mass 110,000 daltons) exist in two states, here called X and Y, with those of the X-state equivalent to the material found predominantly …"
137,Temporal and spatial regulation of fibronectin in early Xenopus development,1984,Gloria Lee and Richard Hynes and Marc Kirschner,"Pattern formation and temporal control of gene expression in Xenopus development were investigated using fibronectin as a biochemical marker. We determined the spatial localization of fibronectin in the embryo by immunofluorescence and the temporal program of its expression by biosynthesis studies and Western blotting techniques. At the start of gastrulation, fibronectin is localized on the roof of the blastoccel which serves as the surface upon which mesodermal cells will migrate. However, since we find fibronectin secreted by all parts of the embryo, localization is probably achieved through spatially localized receptors that bind secreted fibronectin. Fibronectin levels and fibronectin synthesis rates increase following the midblastula stage. This increase is independent of transcription and therefore involves activation of maternal RNA for fibronectin. Since this message mobilization also occurs in activated but …"
138,Activation of the WAVE complex by coincident signals controls actin assembly,2009,Andres M Lebensohn and Marc W Kirschner,"WAVE proteins link upstream signals to actin nucleation by activating the Arp2/3 complex and are at the core of regulatory pathways driving membrane protrusion. They are found in heteropentameric complexes whose role in regulating WAVE function is presently unclear. Here we demonstrate that purified native WAVE complexes are basally inactive; previous reports of constitutive activity are artifacts of in vitro manipulation. Further, the native complexes are not activated by Rac alone. Activation of the WAVE2 complex requires simultaneous interactions with prenylated Rac-GTP and acidic phospholipids, as well as a specific state of phosphorylation. Together these signals promote full activation in a highly cooperative process on the membrane surface, by inducing an allosteric change in the complex rather than by simple recruitment or by dissociation of the subunits. These results explain how the WAVE complex …"
139,Tubulin requires tau for growth onto microtubule initiating sites,1976,George B Witman and Don W Cleveland and Murray D Weingarten and Marc W Kirschner,"Tubulin purified by phosphocellulose chromatography and free of accessory proteins will not form microtubules in the absence or presence of microtubule initiating sites (flagellar microtubules). The capacity for growth onto pre-existing ""seeds"" can be restored by the addition of small quantities of partially purified tau protein. Larger quantities restore the capacity for spontaneous assembly. These results suggest that tubulin requires tau for both initiation and growth of microtubules and that tau is incorporated into the microtubule throughout its length."
140,"Sororin, a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex, is required for sister chromatid cohesion in vertebrates",2005,Susannah Rankin and Nagi G Ayad and Marc W Kirschner,"We have identified a regulator of sister chromatid cohesion in a screen for cell cycle-controlled proteins. This 35 kDa protein is degraded through anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-dependent ubiquitination in G1. The protein is nuclear in interphase cells, dispersed from the chromatin in mitosis, and interacts with the cohesin complex. In Xenopus embryos, overexpression of the protein causes failure to resolve and segregate sister chromatids in mitosis and an increase in the level of cohesin associated with metaphase chromosomes. In cultured cells, depletion of the protein causes mitotic arrest and complete failure of sister chromatid cohesion. This protein is thus an essential, cell cycle-dependent mediator of sister chromatid cohesion. Based on sequence analysis, this protein has no apparent orthologs outside of the vertebrates. We speculate that the protein, which we have named sororin, regulates the ability …"
141,Expression cloning of a Xenopus T-related gene (Xombi) involved in mesodermal patterning and blastopore lip formation,1996,KD Lustig and KL Kroll and EE Sun and MW Kirschner,"We have used a functional assay to identify a putative T-box transcription factor (Xombi) that has the ability to induce sites of invagination in the ectoderm of Xenopus embryos that resemble the blastopore lip. Maternal Xombi transcript is first localized to the oocyte9s vegetal cortex and cytoplasm, early sources of mesoderm and endoderm-inducing signals. Soon after zygotic transcription begins, there is a wave of Xombi expression, beginning in dorsal mesoderm and then extending to lateral and ventral mesoderm, that precedes and parallels blastopore lip formation at the border between the mesoderm and endoderm. Transcripts encoding brachyury, Xwnt8 and goosecoid colocalize with Xombi transcripts within the marginal zone; ectopic expression of Xombi induces expression of all three mesodermal genes. In ectodermal explants, Xombi expression is induced by the secreted mesoderm inducers activinA …"
142,Multiple phases of chondrocyte enlargement underlie differences in skeletal proportions,2013,Kimberly L Cooper and Seungeun Oh and Yongjin Sung and Ramachandra R Dasari and Marc W Kirschner and Clifford J Tabin,"The wide diversity of skeletal proportions in mammals is evident upon a survey of any natural history museum's collections and allows us to distinguish between species even when reduced to their calcified components. Similarly, each individual is comprised of a variety of bones of differing lengths. The largest contribution to the lengthening of a skeletal element, and to the differential elongation of elements, comes from a dramatic increase in the volume of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate as they undergo terminal differentiation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. However, the mechanisms of chondrocyte volume enlargement have remained a mystery 8, 9, 10, 11. Here we use quantitative phase microscopy 12 to show that mammalian chondrocytes undergo three distinct phases of volume increase, including a phase of massive cell swelling in which the cellular dry mass is significantly diluted. In light of the tight fluid …"
143,Targeting cell division: small-molecule inhibitors of FtsZ GTPase perturb cytokinetic ring assembly and induce bacterial lethality,2004,Danielle N Margalit and Laura Romberg and Rebecca B Mets and Alan M Hebert and Timothy J Mitchison and Marc W Kirschner and Debabrata RayChaudhuri,"FtsZ, the ancestral homolog of eukaryotic tubulins, is a GTPase that assembles into a cytokinetic ring structure essential for cell division in prokaryotic cells. Similar to tubulin, purified FtsZ polymerizes into dynamic protofilaments in the presence of GTP; polymer assembly is accompanied by GTP hydrolysis. We used a high-throughput protein-based chemical screen to identify small molecules that target assembly-dependent GTPase activity of FtsZ. Here, we report the identification of five structurally diverse compounds, named Zantrins, which inhibit FtsZ GTPase either by destabilizing the FtsZ protofilaments or by inducing filament hyperstability through increased lateral association. These two classes of FtsZ inhibitors are reminiscent of the antitubulin drugs colchicine and Taxol, respectively. We also show that Zantrins perturb FtsZ ring assembly in Escherichia coli cells and cause lethality to a variety of bacteria in …"
144,Regulation of MPF activity in vitro,1988,Martha S Cyert and Marc W Kirschner,"We have developed a soluble, cell-free system from premeiotic Xenopus oocytes that executes the posttranslational activation of a precursor form of maturation promoting factor (MPF). We have distinguished at least two components of this ATP-dependent reaction: pre-MPF, a precursor to MPF that activates independently of added MPF and whose apparent molecular weight changes from 400 kd to 260 kd upon activation; and INH, an inhibitor of pre-MPF activation that confers MPF dependence on the reaction. We present evidence suggesting that INH is a phosphatase and that the activation of pre-MPF occurs via phosphorylation. INH activity itself seems to be regulated by another phosphatase, protein phosphatase-1. We have directly examined the pattern of protein phosphorylation during the activation reaction and have found 92 and 140 kd proteins whose phosphorylation increases when MPF activity appears …"
145,New features of microtubule behaviour observed in vivo,1988,Eric Schulze and Marc Kirschner,"The microtubule cytoskeleton is thought to be intimately involved in generating and maintaining cell polarity 1, 2 and can generate many different morphological structures from a few structural elements 3. The mechanism by which these structures are generated has been partially elucidated from studies of microtubule polymerization both in vitro 4–6 and in vivo 7, 8. Microtubules in vitro exist in growing (polymerizing) and shrinking (depolymerizing) populations that interconvert infrequently. This behaviour, termed dynamic instability 4, permits microtubules in the cell rapidly to explore different arrangements and allows selective stabilization of specific morphologies 9, 10. To investigate the regulation of these processes, we have implemented techniques for direct observation of fluorescently labelled microtubules 11 and developed them to observe the dynamic behaviour of individual microtubules in single living …"
146,Structure of the Mad2 spindle assembly checkpoint protein and its interaction with Cdc20,2000,Xuelian Luo and Guowei Fang and Melissa Coldiron and Yingxi Lin and Hongtao Yu and Marc W Kirschner and Gerhard Wagner,The checkpoint protein Mad2 inhibits the activity of the anaphase promoting complex by sequestering Cdc20 until all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate. We report the solution structure of human Mad2 and its interaction with Cdc20. Mad2 possesses a novel three-layered α/β fold with three α-helices packed between two β-sheets. Using deletion mutants we identified the minimal Mad2-binding region of human Cdc20 as a 40-residue segment immediately N-terminal to the WD40 repeats. Mutagenesis and NMR titration experiments show that a C-terminal flexible region of Mad2 is required for binding to Cdc20. Mad2 and Cdc20 form a tight 1: 1 heterodimeric complex in which the C-terminal segment of Mad2 becomes folded. These results provide the first structural insight into mechanisms of the spindle assembly checkpoint.
147,Identification of a novel ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in mitotic cyclin degradation,1996,Hongtao Yu and Randall W King and Jan-Michael Peters and Marc W Kirschner,"Background: The destruction of cyclin B is required for exit from mitosis, and is mediated by the ubiquitin pathway. Recently, a 20S complex, termed the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or the cyclosome, has been genetically and biochemically identified as the cyclin-specific ubiquitin ligase (E3). In addition, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), UBC4, was shown to be involved in cyclin ubiquitination in Xenopus egg extracts. Another E2 activity, designated UBCx, can independently support cyclin ubiquitination in Xenopus. A similar activity (E2-C) has also been observed in clams. However, the molecular identity of Xenopus UBCx or clam E2-C has not been established.Results We have purified and cloned Xenopus UBCx. Sequence comparisons with known E2s reveal that UBCx is a novel ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Purified recombinant UBCx is sufficient to complement purified APC and E1 in destruction …"
148,Microtubule behavior during guidance of pioneer neuron growth cones in situ.,1991,James H Sabry and Timothy P O'Connor and Louise Evans and Alma Toroian-Raymond and Marc Kirschner and David Bentley,"The growth of an axon toward its target results from the reorganization of the cytoskeleton in response to environmental guidance cues. Recently developed imaging technology makes it possible to address the effect of such cues on the neural cytoskeleton directly. Although high resolution studies can be carried out on neurons in vitro, these circumstances do not recreate the complexity of the natural environment. We report here on the arrangement and dynamics of microtubules in live neurons pathfinding in response to natural guidance cues in situ using the embryonic grasshopper limb fillet preparation. A rich microtubule network was present within the body of the growth cone and normally extended into the distal growth cone margin. Complex microtubule loops often formed transiently within the growth cone. Branches both with and without microtubules were regularly observed. Microtubules did not extend into …"
149,Pin1 acts catalytically to promote a conformational change in Cdc25,2001,P Todd Stukenberg and Marc W Kirschner,"Pin1 is an essential protein that can peptidyl-prolyl-isomerize small phosphopeptides. It has been suggested that Pin1 regulates entry into mitosis by catalyzing the cis/trans-isomerization of prolines on critical protein substrates in response to phosphorylation. We show that Pin1 catalytically generates a conformational change on the mitotic phosphatase Cdc25, as assayed by limited protease digestion, differential reactivity to a phosphoserine-proline-directed monoclonal antibody (MPM-2), and by changes in Cdc25 enzymatic activity. Pin1 catalytically modifies the conformation of Cdc25 at stoichiometries less than 0.0005, and mutants of Pin1 in the prolyl isomerase domain are not active. We suggest that, although difficult to detect, phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes mediated by prolyl isomerization may play an important regulatory role in the cell cycle."
150,Corequirement of Specific Phosphoinositides and Small GTP-binding Protein Cdc42 in Inducing Actin Assembly in Xenopus Egg Extracts,1998,LE Ma and Lewis C Cantley and Paul A Janmey and Marc W Kirschner,"Both phosphoinositides and small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family have been postulated to regulate actin assembly in cells. We have reconstituted actin assembly in response to these signals in Xenopus extracts and examined the relationship of these pathways. We have found that GTPγS stimulates actin assembly in the presence of endogenous membrane vesicles in low speed extracts. These membrane vesicles are required, but can be replaced by lipid vesicles prepared from purified phospholipids containing phosphoinositides. Vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate can induce actin assembly even in the absence of GTPγS. RhoGDI, a guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for the Rho family, inhibits phosphoinositide-induced actin assembly, suggesting the involvement of the Rho family small G proteins. Using various dominant …"
151,On being the right (cell) size,2015,Miriam B Ginzberg and Ran Kafri and Marc Kirschner,"How do the different cell types in our bodies maintain their distinctive and characteristic sizes? Although much is known about the signaling networks that stimulate or suppress cell growth, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, this central question remains: How do a common set of pathways precisely specify the appropriate size for any given cell type and physiological condition? The precision with which size is controlled is demonstrated by the uniformity in cell size typically seen in tissues. Most epithelial tissues, for example, display a striking regularity in the size and morphology of cells, whereas size heterogeneity can be a sign of neoplastic growth.Most work on the subject of how cell size is regulated has explored the control of cell growth and proliferation by extracellular signals, such as growth factors and cytokines. However, although these signals can dictate the mean …"
152,Microtubule dynamics,1986,Marc W Kirschner and TIM Mitchison,"SIR-Although Williams, Caplow and McIntoshl correctly emphasize the important contribution of Horio and HotanF in verifying, by real-time experiments, the concept of the dynamic instability of microtubules, some of their points are off the mark and they have missed an opportunity to evaluate the proposed explanations for dynamic instability in terms of these and other recent experiments. First, dynamic instability was never meant to imply that shrinking microtubles would always de polymerize to completion. Although we pointed out that the rate constant for this transition would be hard to measure, our own data suggested that microtubles could in fact transit from shrinking to growing3. 4. What wo'uld determine whether a microtuble disappears, in addition to chance, would be its length, the experimental conditions and, probably most importantly, the purity of the tubulin. In the theoretical work of Chen and Hill …"
153,Caspase-dependent activation of cyclin-dependent kinases during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells,1998,Bin-Bing Zhou and Honglin Li and Junying Yuan and Marc W Kirschner,"The activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) has been implicated in apoptosis induced by various stimuli. We find that the Fas-induced activation of cdc2 and cdk2 in Jurkat cells is not dependent on protein synthesis, which is shut down very early during apoptosis before caspase-3 activation. Instead, activation of these kinases seems to result from both a rapid cleavage of Wee1 (an inhibitory kinase of cdc2 and cdk2) and inactivation of anaphase-promoting complex (the specific system for cyclin degradation), in which CDC27 homolog is cleaved during apoptosis. Both Wee1 and CDC27 are shown to be substrates of the caspase-3-like protease. Although cdk activities are elevated during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, general activation of the mitotic processes does not occur. Our results do not support the idea that apoptosis is simply an aberrant mitosis but, instead, suggest that a subset of mitotic …"
154,The Prp19 complex and the Usp4Sart3 deubiquitinating enzyme control reversible ubiquitination at the spliceosome,2010,Eun Joo Song and Shannon L Werner and Jakob Neubauer and Frank Stegmeier and Julie Aspden and Donald Rio and J Wade Harper and Stephen J Elledge and Marc W Kirschner and Michael Rape,"The spliceosome, a dynamic assembly of proteins and RNAs, catalyzes the excision of intron sequences from nascent mRNAs. Recent work has suggested that the activity and composition of the spliceosome are regulated by ubiquitination, but the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, we report that the spliceosomal Prp19 complex modifies Prp3, a component of the U4 snRNP, with nonproteolytic K63-linked ubiquitin chains. The K63-linked chains increase the affinity of Prp3 for the U5 snRNP component Prp8, thereby allowing for the stabilization of the U4/U6.U5 snRNP. Prp3 is deubiquitinated by Usp4 and its substrate targeting factor, the U4/U6 recycling protein Sart3, which likely facilitates ejection of U4 proteins from the spliceosome during maturation of its active site. Loss of Usp4 in cells interferes with the accumulation of correctly spliced mRNAs, including those for α-tubulin and Bub1, and …"
155,The anaphase-promoting complex mediates TGF-β signaling by targeting SnoN for destruction,2001,Yong Wan and Xuedong Liu and Marc W Kirschner,"Degradation of SnoN is thought to play an important role in the transactivation of TGF-β responsive genes. We demonstrate that the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is a ubiquitin ligase required for the destruction of SnoN and that the APC pathway is regulated by TGF-β. The destruction box of SnoN is required for its degradation in response to TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, the APC activator CDH1 and Smad3 synergistically regulate SnoN degradation. Under these circumstances, CDH1 forms a quaternary complex with SnoN, Smad3, and APC. These results suggest that APCCDH1 and SnoN play central roles in regulating growth through the TGF-β signaling system."
156,Dynamics extracted from fixed cells reveal feedback linking cell growth to cell cycle,2013,Ran Kafri and Jason Levy and Miriam B Ginzberg and Seungeun Oh and Galit Lahav and Marc W Kirschner,"Biologists have long been concerned about what constrains variation in cell size, but progress in this field has been slow and stymied by experimental limitations 1. Here we describe a new method, ergodic rate analysis (ERA), that uses single-cell measurements of fixed steady-state populations to accurately infer the rates of molecular events, including rates of cell growth. ERA exploits the fact that the number of cells in a particular state is related to the average transit time through that state 2. With this method, it is possible to calculate full time trajectories of any feature that can be labelled in fixed cells, for example levels of phosphoproteins or total cellular mass. Using ERA we find evidence for a size-discriminatory process at the G1/S transition that acts to decrease cell-to-cell size variation."
157,Direct observation of mammalian cell growth and size regulation,2012,Sungmin Son and Amit Tzur and Yaochung Weng and Paul Jorgensen and Jisoo Kim and Marc W Kirschner and Scott R Manalis,"We introduce a microfluidic system for simultaneously measuring single-cell mass and cell cycle progression over multiple generations. We use this system to obtain over 1,000 h of growth data from mouse lymphoblast and pro–B-cell lymphoid cell lines. Cell lineage analysis revealed a decrease in the growth rate variability at the G1-S phase transition, which suggests the presence of a growth rate threshold for maintaining size homeostasis."
158,UBE2S drives elongation of K11-linked ubiquitin chains by the anaphase-promoting complex,2010,Tao Wu and Yifat Merbl and Ying Huo and Jennifer L Gallop and Amit Tzur and Marc W Kirschner,"The Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates mitosis and G1 by sequentially targeting cell-cycle regulators for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The mechanism of ubiquitin chain formation by APC and the resultant chain topology remains controversial. By using a single-lysine APC substrate to dissect the topology of ubiquitinated substrates, we find that APC-catalyzed ubiquitination has an intrinsic preference for the K11 linkage of ubiquitin that is essential for substrate degradation. K11 specificity is determined by an E2 enzyme, UBE2S/E2-EPF, that elongates ubiquitin chains after the substrates are pre-ubiquitinated by UbcH10 or UbcH5. UBE2S copurifies with APC; dominant-negative Ube2S slows down APC substrate degradation in functional cell-cycle extracts. We propose that Ube2S is a critical, unique component of the APC ubiquitination pathway."
159,Chemical inhibition of N-WASP by stabilization of a native autoinhibited conformation,2004,Jeffrey R Peterson and Lincoln C Bickford and David Morgan and Annette S Kim and Ouathek Ouerfelli and Marc W Kirschner and Michael K Rosen,"Current drug discovery efforts focus primarily on proteins with defined enzymatic or small molecule binding sites. Autoregulatory domains represent attractive alternative targets for small molecule inhibitors because they also occur in noncatalytic proteins and because allosteric inhibitors may avoid specificity problems inherent in active site–directed inhibitors. We report here the identification of wiskostatin, a chemical inhibitor of the neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP). Wiskostatin interacts with a cleft in the regulatory GTPase-binding domain (GBD) of WASP in the solution structure of the complex. Wiskostatin induces folding of the isolated, unstructured GBD into its autoinhibited conformation, suggesting that wiskostatin functions by stabilizing N-WASP in its autoinhibited state. The use of small molecules to bias conformational equilibria represents a potentially general strategy for chemical inhibition …"
160,WAVE2 deficiency reveals distinct roles in embryogenesis and Rac‐mediated actin‐based motility,2003,Catherine Yan and Narcisa Martinez‐Quiles and Sharon Eden and Tomoyuki Shibata and Fuminao Takeshima and Reiko Shinkura and Yuko Fujiwara and Roderick Bronson and Scott B Snapper and Marc W Kirschner and Raif Geha and Fred S Rosen and Frederick W Alt,"The WiskottąAldrich syndrome related protein WAVE2 is implicated in the regulation of actin-cytoskeletal reorganization downstream of the small Rho GTPase, Rac. We inactivated the WAVE2 gene by gene-targeted mutation to examine its role in murine development and in actin assembly. WAVE2-deficient embryos survived until approximately embryonic day 12.5 and displayed growth retardation and certain morphological defects, including malformations of the ventricles in the developing brain. WAVE2-deficient embryonic stem cells displayed normal proliferation, whereas WAVE2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts exhibited severe growth defects, as well as defective cell motility in response to PDGF, lamellipodium formation and Rac-mediated actin polymerization. These results imply a non-redundant role for WAVE2 in murine embryogenesis and a critical role for WAVE2 in actin-based processes downstream of …"
161,The minimum GTP cap required to stabilize microtubules,1994,David N Drechsel and Marc W Kirschner,"Background: Microtubules polymerized from pure tubulin show the unusual property of dynamic instability, in which both growing and shrinking polymers coexist at steady state. Shortly after its addition to a microtubule end, a tubulin subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP. Studies with non-hydrolyzable analogs have shown that GTP hydrolysis is not required for microtubule assembly, but is essential for generating a dynamic polymer, in which the subunits at the growing tip have bound GTP and those in the bulk of the polymer have bound GDP. It has been suggested that loss of the ‘GTP cap’ through dissociation or hydrolysis exposes the unstable GDP core, leading to rapid depolymerization. However, evidence for a stabilizing cap has been very difficult to obtain.Results We developed an assay to determine the minimum GTP cap necessary to stabilize a microtubule from shrinking. Assembly of a small number of …"
162,A reinvestigation of the role of the grey crescent in axis formation in Xenopus laevis,1981,J Gerhart and G Ubbels and S Black and K Hara and M Kirschner,"Gravitationally induced displacements of the contents of the frog egg can predictably determine the orientation of the subsequent dorsal–ventral axis of the embryo, regardless of the original position of sperm entry or of the grey crescent. In certain conditions, these displacements in the egg can also lead to the formation of a second axis, that is, to twinning. The previously reported ability of grafts of grey crescent cortex to induce secondary axes in recipient eggs is interpreted here as an unrecognized twinning effect of gravity. Our results lead us to question the classic interpretation of the grey crescent as a dorsal determinant in amphibian development."
163,Sizzled: a secreted Xwnt8 antagonist expressed in the ventral marginal zone of Xenopus embryos,1997,Adrian N Salic and Kristen L Kroll and Louise M Evans and Marc W Kirschner,"An expression cloning screen was used to isolate a novel gene homologous to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of frizzled receptors. The gene (which we called sizzled for secreted frizzled) was shown to encode a soluble secreted protein, containing a functional signal sequence but no transmembrane domains. Sizzled (szl) is capable of inhibiting Xwnt8 as assayed by (1) dose-dependent inhibition of siamois induction by Xwnt8 in animal caps, (2) rescue of embryos ventralized by Xwnt8 DNA and (3) inhibition of XmyoD expression in the marginal zone. Szl can dorsalize Xenopus embryos if expressed after the midblastula transition, strengthening the idea that zygotic expression of wnts and in particular of Xwnt8 plays a role in antagonizing dorsal signals. It also suggests that inhibiting ventralizing wnts parallels the opposition of BMPs by noggin and chordin. szl expression is restricted to a narrow domain in …"
164,Physiological regulation of β-catenin stability by Tcf3 and CK1ϵ ,2001,Ethan Lee and Adrian Salic and Marc W Kirschner,"The wnt pathway regulates the steady state level of β-catenin, a transcriptional coactivator for the Tcf3/Lef1 family of DNA binding proteins. We demonstrate that Tcf3 can inhibit β-catenin turnover via its competition with axin and adenomatous polyposis for β-catenin binding. A mutant of β-catenin that cannot bind Tcf3 is degraded faster than the wild-type protein in Xenopus embryos and extracts. A fragment of β-catenin and a peptide encoding the NH2 terminus of Tcf4 that block the interaction between β-catenin and Tcf3 stimulate β-catenin degradation, indicating this interaction normally plays an important role in regulating β-catenin turnover. Tcf3 is a substrate for both glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 and casein kinase (CK) 1ϵ, and phosphorylation of Tcf3 by CKIϵ stimulates its binding to β-catenin, an effect reversed by GSK3. Tcf3 synergizes with CK1ϵ to inhibit β-catenin degradation, whereas CKI-7, an …"
165,Mapping gene expression in two Xenopus species: evolutionary constraints and developmental flexibility,2011,Itai Yanai and Leonid Peshkin and Paul Jorgensen and Marc W Kirschner,"Changes in gene expression are thought to be important for morphological evolution, though little is known about the nature or magnitude of the differences. Here, we examine Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis, two amphibians with very similar development, and ask how their transcriptomes compare. Despite separation for ∼30–90 million years, there is strong conservation in gene expression in the vast majority of the expressed orthologs. Significant changes occur in the level of gene expression but changes in the timing of expression (heterochrony) were much less common. Differences in level were concentrated in the earliest embryonic stages. Changes in timing were prominently found in pathways that respond to selective features of the environment. We propose that different evolutionary rates across developmental stages may be explained by the stabilization of cell fate determination in the later stages."
166,Mouse ribonucleotide reductase R2 protein: a new target for anaphase-promoting complex-Cdh1-mediated proteolysis,2003,Anna Lena Chabes and Cathie M Pfleger and Marc W Kirschner and Lars Thelander,"Ribonucleotide reductase consists of two nonidentical proteins, R1 and R2, and catalyzes the rate-limiting step in DNA precursor synthesis: the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. A strictly balanced supply of deoxyribonucleotides is essential for both accurate DNA replication and repair. Therefore, ribonucleotide reductase activity is under exquisite control both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. In proliferating mammalian cells, enzyme activity is regulated by control of R2 protein stability. This control, which responds to DNA damage, is effective until cells pass into mitosis. We demonstrate that the mitotic degradation and hence the overall periodicity of R2 protein levels depends on a KEN box sequence, recognized by the Cdh1–anaphase-promoting complex. The mouse R2 protein specifically binds Cdh1 and is polyubiquitinated in an in vitro ubiquitin assay system. Mutating the KEN …"
167,Deep proteomics of the Xenopus laevis egg using an mRNA-derived reference database,2014,Martin Wühr and Robert M Freeman Jr and Marc Presler and Marko E Horb and Leonid Peshkin and Steven P Gygi and Marc W Kirschner,"Mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables the global identification and quantification of proteins and their posttranslational modifications in complex biological samples. However, proteomic analysis requires a complete and accurate reference set of proteins and is therefore largely restricted to model organisms with sequenced genomes.Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of deep genome-free proteomics by using a reference proteome derived from heterogeneous mRNA data. We identify more than 11,000 proteins with 99% confidence from the unfertilized Xenopus laevis egg and estimate protein abundance with approximately 2-fold precision. Our reference database outperforms the provisional gene models based on genomic DNA sequencing and references generated by other methods. Surprisingly, we find that many proteins in the egg lack mRNA support and that many of these …"
168,"Studies on the expression of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, during mouse brain development, with newly isolated complementary DNA probes.",1984,David G Drubin and Daniel Caput and Marc W Kirschner,"Tau protein is a collection of closely related polypeptides that associate with microtubules in vivo and stimulate their assembly in vitro. Using an affinity-purified antiserum against bovine brain tau protein, we found that the number and amount of tau polypeptides changes dramatically during mouse brain development. The different forms appear to result from changes in tau mRNA since in vitro translation products reflect the qualitative and quantitative changes found in vivo. To study the mRNA and genomic complexity of tau protein, we used tau mRNA, purified from polysomes with tau antiserum, to isolate embryonic mouse tau complementary DNA clones. With these probes we have determined that embryonic tau protein is translated from a 6-kb mRNA that persists throughout brain development."
169,Mitosis in a cell with multiple centrioles.,1982,David Ring and Richard Hubble and Marc Kirschner,"N115 mouse neuroblastoma cells possess a large number of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) which can be identified ultrastructurally as single centrioles. The distribution and activity of these organizing centers can be followed through all stages of the cell cycle by labeling microtubules with anti-tubulin and chromatin with the Hoechst dye, Bisbenzimid. We have found that multiple MTOCs persist and continue to organize microtubules during mitosis. They exhibit a well-defined sequence of movements, starting from a loose cluster during interphase, proceeding to a widely and evenly dispersed arrangement in prophase, gathering into small clusters and chains during prometaphase, and residing in two ring-shaped groups at the mitotic poles during metaphase and anaphase. Despite their large number of centrioles, virtually all N115 cells show a normal bipolar mitosis, but often with unequal numbers of …"
170,"Tome-1, a trigger of mitotic entry, is degraded during G1 via the APC",2003,Nagi G Ayad and Susannah Rankin and Monica Murakami and Judith Jebanathirajah and Steven Gygi and Marc W Kirschner,"Entry into mitosis requires the activation of cdk1/cyclin B, while mitotic exit is achieved when the same kinase activity decreases, as cyclin B is degraded. Cyclin B proteolysis is mediated by the anaphase promoting complex, or APC, an E3 ligase that is active at anaphase in mitosis through G1. We have identified a G1 substrate of the APC that we have termed Tome-1, for trigger of mitotic entry. Tome-1 is a cytosolic protein required for proper activation of cdk1/cyclin B and mitotic entry. Tome-1 associates with Skp-1 and is required for degradation of the cdk1 inhibitory tyrosine kinase wee1; Tome-1 therefore appears to be acting as part of an SCF-type E3 for wee1. Degradation of Tome-1 during G1 allows for wee 1 accumulation during interphase, thereby providing a critical link between the APC and SCF pathways in regulation of cdk1/cyclin B activity and thus mitotic entry and exit."
171,Immunoflourescent staining of cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules in mouse fibroblasts with antibody to tau protein,1977,Joe A Connolly and Vitauts I Kalnins and Don W Cleveland and Marc W Kirschner,"tau protein isolated from porcine brain microtubules was further purified by electrophoretic elution from polyacrylamide gels and used to prepare antisera in rabbits. The antiserum to tau specifically stains mitotic spindles and a filamentous network within mouse fibroblasts when the indirect immunofluorescence technique is used. The staining of the filamentous network and mitotic spindles is identical to that observed when cells are treated with antiserum prepared against electrophoretically purified tubulin. The filamentous network observed with either serum is sensitive to Colcemid. Absorption of anti-tau serum with electrophoretically purified tubulin does not remove the immunofluorescent staining of the mitotic spindle, whereas absorption with electrophoretically purified tau protein does. Conversely, absorption of antitubulin serum with tubulin eliminates its ability to stain the mitotic spindle, whereas absorption …"
172,Microtubule polymer assembly and transport during axonal elongation.,1991,Sigrid S Reinsch and Timothy J Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,"As axons elongate, tubulin, which is synthesized in the cell body, must be transported and assembled into new structures in the axon. The mechanism of transport and the location of assembly are presently unknown. We report here on the use of tubulin tagged with a photoactivatable fluorescent group to investigate these issues. Photoactivatable tubulin, microinjected into frog embryos at the two-cell stage, is incorporated into microtubules in neurons obtained from explants of the neural tube. When activated by light, a fluorescent mark is made on the microtubules in the axon, and transport and turnover can be visualized directly. We find that microtubules are generated in or near the cell body and continually transported distally as a coherent phase of polymer during axon elongation. This vectorial polymer movement was observed at all levels on the axon, even in the absence of axonal elongation. Measurements of …"
173,Regulation of microtubule protein levels during cellular morphogenesis in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells.,1988,David Drubin and Sumire Kobayashi and Doug Kellogg and Marc Kirschner,"Nerve growth factor induces neurite process formation in pheochromacytoma (PC12) cells and causes the parallel increase in levels of the microtubule-associated proteins, tau and MAP1, as well as increases in tubulin levels. Mechanisms to insure balanced accumulation of microtubule proteins and make their levels highly responsive to nerve growth factor were investigated. The effects on tau, MAP1, and tubulin are due to changes in protein synthesis rates, which for tau and tubulin we could show are due in part to changes in the mRNA levels. Whereas tubulin shows feedback regulation to modulate synthesis up or down, tau protein synthesis is not affected in a straightforward way by microtubule polymerization and depolymerization. The degradation of tau, MAP1, and both tubulin polypeptides, however, are stimulated by microtubule depolymerization caused by colchicine, or nerve growth factor removal …"
174,Turnover of tubulin and the N site GTP in Chinese hamster ovary cells,1977,Bruce M Spiegelman and Stephen M Penningroth and Marc W Kirschner,"Radioactively labeled tubulin from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells can be isolated by copolymerization with nonradioactive porcine brain microtubule protein. 75% of the soluble tubulin in CHO extracts co-polymerizes with the porcine protein through several cycles, without preferential loss of either CHO or porcine subunits. After phosphocellulose chromatography of the co-polymerized microtubules, the CHO tubulin is radiochemically homogeneous, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. CHO tubulin purified in this way has 1 mole of nucleotide per mole of protein noncovalently bound at the non-exchangeable or N site. Thin-layer chromatography indicates that the N site nucleotide is entirely ribo-GTP. Label and chase experiments show that the N site GTP exchanges intracellularly with a half-time of 33 hr in growing cells which have a generation time of 17 hr, while the tubulin poly-peptides are …"
175,Properties of the depolymerization products of microtubules from mammalian brain,1974,Murray D Weingarten and Mary M Suter and Dan R Littman and Marc W Kirschner,"Murray D. Weingarten,* Mary M. Suter, Dan R. Littman, and Marc W. Kirschner* abstract: Preparations of microtubules, isolated from porcine brain by a method of repeated polymerization and depolymerization, consist of 95% pure a and/3 tubulin, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Depo-lymerization of these tubules, either by addition of 1 mM CaCh or by cooling to 4, produces two protein components with s 20, w of 6 and 36S, as judged by analytical ultracen-trifugation. The proportion of protein in the36S form varies from 30 to 80% depending on the total protein con-centration and the method of depolymerization. The depo-lymerized mixture can be resolved into two fractions bygel permeation chromatography. The leading fraction contains the 36S component, which forms 80% of the protein, and a 6S component which forms 20% of the protein. The trailing fraction is composed of only 6S …"
176,Substrate degradation by the proteasome: a single-molecule kinetic analysis,2015,Ying Lu and Byung-hoon Lee and Randall W King and Daniel Finley and Marc W Kirschner,"Protein degradation, mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), plays a critical and complementary role to transcription, splicing, and translation in the control of gene expression. Effective regulation of the UPS relies on the specificity of substrate recognition, which is conferred largely by the upstream ubiquitylation process. As a specific example, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) acting on a series of substrates promotes waves of ubiquitylation and degradation, leading to key transitions in the cell cycle. However, in this cascade the proteasome itself also plays a role in the specificity of degradation. There have been various efforts to characterize this role, leading to a commonly held view that a substrate protein must be conjugated with a chain of at least four ubiquitins to be recognized by the proteasome. Yet mass spectrometry studies show that ubiquitin chains on APC substrates …"
177,"Hem-1 complexes are essential for Rac activation, actin polymerization, and myosin regulation during neutrophil chemotaxis",2006,Orion D Weiner and Maike C Rentel and Alex Ott and Glenn E Brown and Mark Jedrychowski and Michael B Yaffe and Steven P Gygi and Lewis C Cantley and Henry R Bourne and Marc W Kirschner,"Migrating cells need to make different actin assemblies at the cell's leading and trailing edges and to maintain physical separation of signals for these assemblies. This asymmetric control of activities represents one important form of cell polarity. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the components involved in generating and maintaining polarity during chemotaxis. Here we characterize a family of complexes (which we term leading edge complexes), scaffolded by hematopoietic protein 1 (Hem-1), that organize the neutrophil's leading edge. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE)2 complex, which mediates activation of actin polymerization by Rac, is only one member of this family. A subset of these leading edge complexes are biochemically separable from the WAVE2 complex and contain a diverse set of potential polarity-regulating proteins. RNA interference–mediated knockdown of Hem-1–containing complexes in neutrophil-like cells: (a) dramatically impairs attractant-induced actin polymerization, polarity, and chemotaxis; (b) substantially weakens Rac activation and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-tris-phosphate production, disrupting the (phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-tris-phosphate)/Rac/F-actin–mediated feedback circuit that organizes the leading edge; and (c) prevents exclusion of activated myosin from the leading edge, perhaps by misregulating leading edge complexes that contain inhibitors of the Rho-actomyosin pathway. Taken together, these observations show that versatile Hem-1–containing complexes coordinate diverse regulatory signals at the leading edge of polarized …"
178,Optimizing optical flow cytometry for cell volume-based sorting and analysis,2011,Amit Tzur and Jodene K Moore and Paul Jorgensen and Howard M Shapiro and Marc W Kirschner,"Cell size is a defining characteristic central to cell function and ultimately to tissue architecture. The ability to sort cell subpopulations of different sizes would facilitate investigation at genomic and proteomic levels of mechanisms by which cells attain and maintain their size. Currently available cell sorters, however, cannot directly measure cell volume electronically, and it would therefore be desirable to know which of the optical measurements that can be made in such instruments provide the best estimate of volume. We investigated several different light scattering and fluorescence measurements in several different cell lines, sorting cell fractions from the high and low end of distributions, and measuring volume electronically to determine which sorting strategy yielded the best separated volume distributions. Since we found that different optical measurements were optimal for different cell lines, we suggest that following this procedure will enable other investigators to optimize their own cell sorters for volume-based separation of the cell types with which they work."
179,Regulation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor in early Xenopus embryos.,1990,Thomas J Musci and Enrique Amaya and Marc W Kirschner,"Recent evidence suggests that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a primary mesoderm inducer in Xenopus development. We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone for the Xenopus FGF receptor. Like other FGF receptors, the Xenopus homolog is a membrane-spanning protein with a split intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The Xenopus FGF receptor mRNA is present as a maternal message whose levels are constant through early development. There is no specific regional localization of the transcript by analysis of FGF receptor mRNA levels in microdissected embryonic tissue. In isolated animal-pole blastomeres, FGF receptor mRNA declines over 16 hr in culture and this loss can be prevented by incubation with FGF or activin. Despite the presence of the FGF receptor mRNA in the oocyte, oocytes in culture do not respond to added FGF. However, injection of exogenous Xenopus FGF receptor transcripts into …"
180,Nucleotide binding and phosphorylation in microtubule assembly in vitro,1977,Stephen M Penningroth and Marc W Kirschner,"Two non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP, guanylyl-β,γ-methylene diphosphonate and guanylyl imidodiphosphate, have been found to induce rapid and efficient microtubule assembly in vitro by binding at the exchangeable site (E-site) on tubulin. Characterization of microtubule polymerization by several criteria, including polymerization kinetics, nucleotide binding to depolymerized and polymerized microtubules, and microtubule stability, reveals strong similarities between microtubule assembly induced by GTP and non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs. Nucleoside triphosphates which bind weakly or not at all to tubulin, such as ATP, UTP and CTP, are shown to induce microtubule assembly by means of a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP-kinase, EC 2.7.4.6.) activity which is not intrinsic to tubulin. The NDP-kinase mediates microtubule polymerization by phosphorylating tubulin-bound GDP in situ at the E-site …"
181,Microtubule assembly in cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus oocytes and eggs.,1987,David L Gard and Marc W Kirschner,"We have investigated the differences in microtubule assembly in cytoplasm from Xenopus oocytes and eggs in vitro. Extracts of activated eggs could be prepared that assembled extensive microtubule networks in vitro using Tetrahymena axonemes or mammalian centrosomes as nucleation centers. Assembly occurred predominantly from the plus-end of the microtubule with a rate constant of 2 microns.min-1.microM-1 (57 s-1.microM-1). At the in vivo tubulin concentration, this corresponds to the extraordinarily high rate of 40-50 microns.min-1. Microtubule disassembly rates in these extracts were -4.5 microns.min-1 (128 s-1) at the plus-end and -6.9 microns.min-1 (196 s-1) at the minus-end. The critical concentration for plus-end microtubule assembly was 0.4 microM. These extracts also promoted the plus-end assembly of microtubules from bovine brain tubulin, suggesting the presence of an assembly promoting …"
182,Evidence for a functional role of the cytoskeleton in determination of the dorsoventral axis in Xenopus laevis eggs,1983,Geertje A Ubbels and K Hara and CH Koster and MW Kirschner,"A normal table of events of the first cleavage period in the fertilized egg (cf. Gerhart, 1980) has been completed (cf. Table I) by studying external and internal features. Through a cytological study of eggs fixed after video time-lapse observation such featurescan directly be correlated and it has been shown that the first postfertilization wave (PFW) reflects spermaster growth, which causes rearrangements of animal yolk material. Thismay, in conjunction with the interaction of the spermaster rays with the cortex, define, in time as well as in space, the asymmetric cortical contraction which we suppose to evoke asymmetry in the animal hemisphere by formation of the vitelline wall (Pasteels, 1964) and in the vegetal hemisphere by formation of the Vegetal Dorsalising Centre (Kirschneret al. 1981).Neither prick-activated eggs nor fertilized eggs incubated in vinblastine develop a spermaster. Under these conditions abnormal …"
183,Hemichordate genomes and deuterostome origins,2015,Oleg Simakov and Takeshi Kawashima and Ferdinand Marlétaz and Jerry Jenkins and Ryo Koyanagi and Therese Mitros and Kanako Hisata and Jessen Bredeson and Eiichi Shoguchi and Fuki Gyoja and Jia-Xing Yue and Yi-Chih Chen and Robert M Freeman and Akane Sasaki and Tomoe Hikosaka-Katayama and Atsuko Sato and Manabu Fujie and Kenneth W Baughman and Judith Levine and Paul Gonzalez and Christopher Cameron and Jens H Fritzenwanker and Ariel M Pani and Hiroki Goto and Miyuki Kanda and Nana Arakaki and Shinichi Yamasaki and Jiaxin Qu and Andrew Cree and Yan Ding and Huyen H Dinh and Shannon Dugan and Michael Holder and Shalini N Jhangiani and Christie L Kovar and Sandra L Lee and Lora R Lewis and Donna Morton and Lynne V Nazareth and Geoffrey Okwuonu and Jireh Santibanez and Rui Chen and Stephen Richards and Donna M Muzny and Andrew Gillis and Leonid Peshkin and Michael Wu and Tom Humphreys and Yi-Hsien Su and Nicholas H Putnam and Jeremy Schmutz and Asao Fujiyama and Jr-Kai Yu and Kunifumi Tagawa and Kim C Worley and Richard A Gibbs and Marc W Kirschner and Christopher J Lowe and Noriyuki Satoh and Daniel S Rokhsar and John Gerhart,"Acorn worms, also known as enteropneust (literally,‘gut-breathing’) hemichordates, are marine invertebrates that share features with echinoderms and chordates. Together, these three phyla comprise the deuterostomes. Here we report the draft genome sequences of two acorn worms, Saccoglossus kowalevskii and Ptychodera flava. By comparing them with diverse bilaterian genomes, we identify shared traits that were probably inherited from the last common deuterostome ancestor, and then explore evolutionary trajectories leading from this ancestor to hemichordates, echinoderms and chordates. The hemichordate genomes exhibit extensive conserved synteny with amphioxus and other bilaterians, and deeply conserved non-coding sequences that are candidates for conserved gene-regulatory elements. Notably, hemichordates possess a deuterostome-specific genomic cluster of four ordered transcription …"
184,The identification of two novel ligands of the FGF receptor by a yeast screening method and their activity in Xenopus development,1995,Noriyuki Kinoshita and Jeremy Minshull and Marc W Kirschner,"We have developed a functional screen in yeast to identify ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases. Using this method, we cloned two Xenopus genes that activate the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. These encode novel secreted proteins, designated FRL1 and FRL2, distantly related to the epidermal growth factor and angiogenin/ribonuclease families, respectively. Both genes activate the FGF receptor in Xenopus oocytes as well as in yeast. Overexpression induces mesoderm and neural-specific genes in Xenopus explants; induction is blocked by a dominant negative inhibitor of the FGF receptor. FRL1 is broadly expressed during gastrulation and neurulation, while FRL2 is expressed principally in the axial mesoderm and brain at later stages. Our results indicate that despite their lack of similarity with FGF, FRL1 and FRL2 are ligands for the FGF receptor that play distinct roles in development."
185,Properties of the kinetochore in vitro. I. Microtubule nucleation and tubulin binding.,1985,TJ Mitchison and MW Kirschner,"We have isolated chromosomes from Chinese hamster ovary cells arrested in mitosis with vinblastine and examined the interactions of their kinetochores with purified tubulin in vitro. The kinetochores nucleate microtubule (MT) growth with complex kinetics. After an initial lag phase, MTs are continuously nucleated with both plus and minus ends distally localized. This mixed polarity seems inconsistent with the formation of an ordered, homopolar kinetochore fiber in vivo. As isolated from vinblastine-arrested cells, kinetochores contain no bound tubulin. The kinetochores of chromosomes isolated from colcemid-arrested cells or of chromosomes incubated with tubulin in vitro are brightly stained after anti-tubulin immunofluorescence. This bound tubulin is probably not in the form of MTs. It is localized to the corona region by immunoelectron microscopy, where it may play a role in MT nucleation in vitro."
186,Self-assembly of filopodia-like structures on supported lipid bilayers,2010,Kwonmoo Lee and Jennifer L Gallop and Komal Rambani and Marc W Kirschner,"Filopodia are finger-like protrusive structures, containing actin bundles. By incubating frog egg extracts with supported lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate, we have reconstituted the assembly of filopodia-like structures (FLSs). The actin assembles into parallel bundles, and known filopodial components localize to the tip and shaft. The filopodia tip complexes self-organize—they are not templated by preexisting membrane microdomains. The F-BAR domain protein toca-1 recruits N-WASP, followed by the Arp2/3 complex and actin. Elongation proteins, Diaphanous-related formin, VASP, and fascin are recruited subsequently. Although the Arp2/3 complex is required for FLS initiation, it is not essential for elongation, which involves formins. We propose that filopodia form via clustering of Arp2/3 complex activators, self-assembly of filopodial tip complexes on the membrane, and outgrowth of …"
187,Microtubule bending and breaking in living fibroblast cells,1999,David J Odde and Le Ma and Amelie H Briggs and Alyssa DeMarco and Marc W Kirschner,"Microtubules in living cells frequently bend and occasionally break, suggesting that relatively strong forces act on them. Bending implies an increase in microtubule lattice energy, which could in turn affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of microtubule-associated processes such as breaking. Here we show that the rate of microtubule breaking in fibroblast cells increases approximately 40-fold as the elastic energy stored in curved microtubules increases to > approximately 1 kT/tubulin dimer. In addition, the length-normalized breaking rate is sufficiently large (2.3 breaks × mm(−1) × minute(−1)) to infer that breaking is likely a major mechanism by which noncentrosomal microtubules are generated. Together the results suggest a physiologically important, microtubule-based mechanism for mechanochemical information processing in the cell."
188,The role of microtubules in growth cone turning at substrate boundaries.,1995,Elly Tanaka and Marc W Kirschner,"To understand the role of microtubules in growth cone turning, we observed fluorescently labeled microtubules in neurons as they encountered a substrate boundary. Neurons growing on a laminin-rich substrate avoided growing onto collagen type IV. Turning growth cones assumed heterogeneous morphologies and behaviors that depended primarily in their extent of adhesion to the substrate. We grouped these behaviors into three categories-sidestepping, motility, and growth-mediated reorientation. In sidestepping and motility-mediated reorientation, the growth cone and parts of the axon were not well attached to the substrate so the acquisition of an adherent lamella caused the entire growth cone to move away from the border and consequently reoriented the axon. In these cases, since the motility of the growth cone dominates its reorientation, the microtubules were passive, and reorientation occurred without …"
189,Autoimmune response directed against conserved determinants of nuclear envelope proteins in a patient with linear scleroderma,1983,Frank D McKeon and Denny L Tuffanelli and Kimie Fukuyama and Marc W Kirschner,"We have studied the autoantibodies in the serum of a patient with linear scleroderma that specifically recognize the nuclear envelope of cultured cells. These antibodies bind to conserved determinants of nuclear lamins, the predominant mammalian nuclear envelope proteins. Of the three mammalian nuclear lamin proteins (970, P68, and P60), only P70 and P60 bind the autoantibodies. In addition, two proteins of the Drosophila embryonic nuclear matrix, P70 and P68, bind these autoantibodies. We have used nuclear matrices to isolate the autoantibodies from the patient9s serum that react to the nuclear lamins. At least three different IgG heavy chains were found to be involved in this autoimmune response to nuclear lamins, indicating that this response is not due to the expansion of a single B-cell clone."
190,Cell cycle-regulated multi-site phosphorylation of Neurogenin 2 coordinates cell cycling with differentiation during neurogenesis,2011,Fahad Ali and Chris Hindley and Gary McDowell and Richard Deibler and Alison Jones and Marc Kirschner and Francois Guillemot and Anna Philpott,"During development of the central nervous system, the transition from progenitor maintenance to differentiation is directly triggered by a lengthening of the cell cycle that occurs as development progresses. However, the mechanistic basis of this regulation is unknown. The proneural transcription factor Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) acts as a master regulator of neuronal differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that Ngn2 is phosphorylated on multiple serine-proline sites in response to rising cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) levels. This multi-site phosphorylation results in quantitative inhibition of the ability of Ngn2 to induce neurogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, multi-site phosphorylation inhibits binding of Ngn2 to E box DNA, and inhibition of DNA binding depends on the number of phosphorylation sites available, quantitatively controlling promoter occupancy in a rheostat-like manner. Neuronal differentiation driven …"
191,Maturation-promoting factor induces nuclear envelope breakdown in cycloheximide-arrested embryos of Xenopus laevis.,1983,Ryn Miake-Lye and John Newport and Marc Kirschner,"We have studied the effect of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) on embryonic nuclei during the early cleavage stage of Xenopus laevis development. When protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide during this stage, the embryonic cell cycle arrests in an artificially produced G2 phase-like state, after completion of one additional round of DNA synthesis. Approximately 100 nuclei can be arrested in a common cytoplasm if cytokinesis is first inhibited by cytochalasin B. Within 5 min after injection of MPF into such embryos, the nuclear envelope surrounding each nucleus disperses, as determined histologically or by immunofluorescent staining of the nuclear lamina with antilamin antiserum. The breakdown of the nuclear envelope occurs at levels of MPF comparable to or slightly lower than those required for oocyte maturation. Amplification of MPF activity, however, does not occur in the arrested egg as it does in …"
192,Inhibition of Cdh1–APC by the MAD2-related protein MAD2L2: a novel mechanism for regulating Cdh1,2001,Cathie M Pfleger and Adrian Salic and Ethan Lee and Marc W Kirschner,"Exit from mitosis requires the degradation of regulatory proteins including the mitotic cyclins and securin through ubiquitination by the anaphase promoting complex (APC) bound to Cdc20 or Cdh1. Cdc20–APC is regulated through inhibition by the spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2. Knowledge of Cdh1–APC regulation is limited to the phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of Cdh1 from APC. We report a novel means of regulating Cdh1 by the MAD2-related gene, MAD2L2. MAD2L2 specifically binds and inhibits Cdh1–APC, paralleling the effect of MAD2 on Cdc20. We suggest that MAD2L2 and MAD2 inhibit the release of substrates from APC and propose a mechanism of inhibition."
193,Regulation of Cdc25C by ERK-MAP kinases during the G2/M transition,2007,Ruoning Wang and Guangan He and Mayra Nelman-Gonzalez and Cheryl L Ashorn and Gary E Gallick and P Todd Stukenberg and Marc W Kirschner and Jian Kuang,"Induction of G2/M phase transition in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles requires activation by phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase Cdc25. Although Cdc2/cyclin B and polo-like kinase (PLK) can phosphorylate and activate Cdc25 in vitro, phosphorylation by these two kinases is insufficient to account for Cdc25 activation during M phase induction. Here we demonstrate that p42 MAP kinase (MAPK), the Xenopus ortholog of ERK2, is a major Cdc25 phosphorylating kinase in extracts of M phase-arrested Xenopus eggs. In Xenopus oocytes, p42 MAPK interacts with hypophosphorylated Cdc25 before meiotic induction. During meiotic induction, p42 MAPK phosphorylates Cdc25 at T48, T138, and S205, increasing Cdc25's phosphatase activity. In a mammalian cell line, ERK1/2 interacts with Cdc25C in interphase and phosphorylates Cdc25C at T48 in mitosis. Inhibition of ERK activation partially inhibits T48 …"
194,On the relationship of protein and mRNA dynamics in vertebrate embryonic development,2015,Leonid Peshkin and Martin Wühr and Esther Pearl and Wilhelm Haas and Robert M Freeman Jr and John C Gerhart and Allon M Klein and Marko Horb and Steven P Gygi and Marc W Kirschner,"A biochemical explanation of development from the fertilized egg to the adult requires an understanding of the proteins and RNAs expressed over time during embryogenesis. We present a comprehensive characterization of protein and mRNA dynamics across early development in Xenopus. Surprisingly, we find that most protein levels change little and duplicated genes are expressed similarly. While the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is poor, a mass action kinetics model parameterized using protein synthesis and degradation rates regresses protein dynamics to RNA dynamics, corrected for initial protein concentration. This study provides detailed data for absolute levels of ∼10,000 proteins and ∼28,000 transcripts via a convenient web portal, a rich resource for developmental biologists. It underscores the lasting impact of maternal dowry, finds surprisingly few cases where degradation alone …"
195,"Nuclear lamin LI of Xenopus laevis: cDNA cloning, amino acid sequence and binding specificity of a member of the lamin B subfamily.",1987,Georg Krohne and SL Wolin and FD McKeon and WW Franke and MW Kirschner,"Lamins are karyoskeletal proteins associated with the nuclear envelope which can be divided into two groups, i.e. the type A lamins of near neutral pI and the more acidic lamins, including mammalian lamin B. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding a representative of the type B subfamily from Xenopus laevis, and have deduced its amino acid sequence from the coding portion of the approximately 2.9 kb mRNA. The polypeptide (mol. wt 66,433) is identified as a typical lamin by its homology to Xenopus human type A lamins, but detailed sequence comparison shows that LI is less related to Xenopus lamin A than the latter is to human lamin A. The conformation predicted for LI conforms to the general model of lamins and intermediate filament proteins and is characterized by an extended central alpha‐helical coiled coil domain, flanked by non‐alpha‐helical domains, i.e. a relatively short N‐terminal head and a …"
196,Aster formation in eggs of Xenopus laevis. Induction by isolated basal bodies.,1975,Steven R Heidemann and Marc W Kirschner,"We have assayed various materials for their ability to induce aster formation by microinjection into unfertilized eggs of Xenopus laevis. We have found that purified basal bodies from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Tetrahymena pyriformis induce the formation of asters and irregular cleavage furrows within 1 h after injection. Other microtubule structures such as flagella, flagellar axonemes, cilia, and brain microtubules are completely ineffective at inducing asters or cleavage furrows in unfertilized eggs. When known amounts of sonicated Tetrahymena and Chlamydomonas preparations are injected into unfertilized eggs, 50% of the injected eggs show a furrowing response at approximately 3 cell equvalents for Chlamydomonas and 0.1 cell equivalent for Tetrahymena. These results are close to those expected if basal bodies were the effective astral-inducing agent in these cells. Other materials effective at inducing …"
197,Clustering of Nck by a 12-residue Tir phosphopeptide is sufficient to trigger localized actin assembly,2004,Kenneth G Campellone and Susannah Rankin and Tony Pawson and Marc W Kirschner and Donald J Tipper and John M Leong,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) translocates effector proteins into mammalian cells to promote reorganization of the cytoskeleton into filamentous actin pedestals. One effector, Tir, is a transmembrane receptor for the bacterial surface adhesin intimin, and intimin binding by the extracellular domain of Tir is required for actin assembly. The cytoplasmic NH2 terminus of Tir interacts with focal adhesion proteins, and its tyrosine-phosphorylated COOH terminus binds Nck, a host adaptor protein critical for pedestal formation. To define the minimal requirements for EPEC-mediated actin assembly, Tir derivatives were expressed in mammalian cells in the absence of all other EPEC components. Replacement of the NH2 terminus of Tir with a viral membrane-targeting sequence promoted efficient surface expression of a COOH-terminal Tir fragment. Artificial clustering of this fusion protein revealed that the COOH …"
198,Role of the centrosome in organizing the interphase microtubule array: properties of cytoplasts containing or lacking centrosomes.,1984,Eric Karsenti and Sumire Kobayashi and Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,"To study the role of the centrosome in microtubule organization in interphase cells, we developed a method for obtaining cytoplasts (cells lacking a nucleus) that did or did not contain centrosomes. After drug-induced microtubule depolymerization, cytoplasts with centrosomes made from sparsely plated cells reconstituted a microtubule array typical of normal cells. Under these conditions cytoplasts without centrosomes formed only a few scattered microtubules. This difference in degree of polymerization suggests that centrosomes affect not only the distribution but the amount of microtubules in cells. To our surprise, the extent of microtubules assembled increased with the cell density of the original culture. At confluent density, cytoplasts without centrosomes had many microtubules, equivalent to cytoplasts with centrosomes. The additional microtubules were arranged peripherally and differed from the centrosomal …"
199,Direct observation of steady-state microtubule dynamics.,1986,David Kristofferson and Tim Mitchison and Marc Kirschner,"Different types of unusual dynamic behavior have been reported for steady-state microtubules. While almost all earlier reports relied on kinetic measurements of bulk polymerization, we have directly visualized the steady-state addition of subunits to individual microtubules through the use of tubulin derivitized with biotin. Biotinylated tubulin was used both as an internal ""seed"" for polymerization and as a marker for assembly onto the ends of microtubules composed of purified tubulin. Biotinylated segments were distinguished from unmodified tubulin by double-label immunofluorescence. Microtubule lengths, number concentrations, and segment lengths have been monitored with time at steady state under two buffer conditions. The results indicate that the microtubule steady state under these conditions is a balance between a majority of slowly growing microtubules and a minority of rapidly depolymerizing ones as …"
200,Intracellular localization of the high molecular weight microtubule accessory protein by indirect immunofluorescence.,1978,Joe A Connolly and Vitauts I Kalnins and Don W Cleveland and Marc W Kirschner,"Microtubule accessory proteins were isolated from porcine brain microtubules by phosphocellulose chromatography, and the high molecular weight protein (HMW protein), purified from this microtubule-associated fraction by electrophoretic elution from SDS gels, was used to raise antisera in rabbits. In agarose double diffusion tests, the antiserum obtained forms precipitin lines with purified HMW protein but not with tau protein or tubulin. When rat glial cells (strain C6) are examined by indirect immunofluorescence, this serum specifically stains a colchicine-sensitive filamentous cytoplasmic network in interphase cells, a network indistinguishable from that seen when cells are treated with antitubulin serum. In dividing cells, specific staining of the mitotic spindle and the stem body is observed with the antiserum to HMW protein. These studies indicate that HMW protein, like tau protein, is associated with microtubules in …"
201,Stable transformation of an Arabidopsis cell suspension culture with firefly luciferase providing a cellular system for analysis of chaperone activity in vivo.,1997,Christoph Forreiter and Marc Kirschner and Lutz Nover,"Using Agrobacterium, we developed a method to transform an Arabidopsis cell suspension culture. A stably transformed cell line expressing high levels of firefly luciferase (Luc) was used for in vivo studies of thermal denaturation and renaturation of the enzyme and the protective role of different chaperones. Luc activity was monitored under heat stress and recovery conditions in control, thermotolerant cells and cells expressing plant chaperones after transient cotransformation with plasmids encoding proteins of the heat shock protein Hsp90, Hsp70, or Hsp20 family. The effects of the expressed proteins were specific. The Hsp17.6 class I protein maintained Luc activity on a level comparable with that observed in thermotolerant cells and improved Luc renaturation. Although transient expression of Hsp90 did not protect Luc from thermal denaturation, it accelerated Luc renaturation during recovery. In contrast to the …"
202,Autoregulation of tubulin synthesis in hepatocytes and fibroblasts.,1985,Joan M Caron and Albert L Jones and Marc W Kirschner,"Microtubule polymer levels in mouse 3T6 fibroblasts and primary cultures of rat hepatocytes can be manipulated by treatment of cells with long term, low doses of colcemid. Such treatment produces a rather uniform population of cells with microtubules of reduced lengths. Using this system, we demonstrate (a) that the rate of tubulin synthesis is sensitive to small changes (10%) in microtubule polymer mass and (b) that the percent of inhibition of synthesis is proportional to the level of soluble tubulin. Experiments with hepatocytes indicate that not only synthesis but the stability of tubulin protein was also regulated to maintain a specific level of tubulin. Treatment of hepatocytes with colcemid or other microtubule-depolymerizing drugs reduced the half-life of tubulin from 50 to 2 h, whereas taxol, which stabilizes microtubules, increased the half-life. To assess the consequences of altering microtubule polymer mass, we …"
203,Cyclin in fission yeast,1988,Mark Solomon and Robert Booher and Marc Kirschner and David Beach,"Genetic studies of the fission yeast cell cycle have identified the cdc2 gene as a critical regulator of M phase (Nurse and Thuriaux, 1980). The gene encodes a protein kinase (Simanis and Nurse, 1986) that is homologous to the product of the CDC28 cell cycle"" start"" gene of budding yeast (Beach et al., 1982). More recently it has become apparent that all eukaryotes including man have a similar protein kinase (Draetta et al., 1987; Lee and Nurse, 1987). Recent evidence suggests that the Xenopus homolog of the cdc2 product is a component of maturation promoting factor (MPF; Dunphy et al., 1988; Gautier et al., 1988), an activity that is capable of driving interphase nuclei into a mitotic state both in vivo and in vitro and that oscillates during the mitotic cell cycle (Gerhart et al., 1984; Newport and Kirschner, 1984).A variety of other genes that interact genetically with cdc2 have been found. Some, such as wee1, are …"
204,Anticentromere and anticentriole antibodies in the scleroderma spectrum,1983,Denny L Tuffanelli and Frank McKeon and M Kleinsmith D'Anne and Thomas K Burnham and Marc Kirschner,"• We studied serum samples from 106 patients, including 80 in the scleroderma spectrum, by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, using PtK, rat kangaroo tissue culture cells as substrate. Anticentromere (Kinetochore) antibodies were present in 28 patients, and anticentriole antibodies were present in four patients. Anticentromere antibodies were usually present in patients with a benign, chronic form of systemic scleroderma, which has been termed theCREST(Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal involvement, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome. The four patients with a previously undescribed anticentriole antibody were all in the scleroderma spectrum. Possibly, these antibodies may have diagnostic and prognostic importance. Further, they will be useful in studying the structure and function of these cellular organelles.(Arch Dermatol1983;119:560-566)"
205,Differential expression of multiple U1 small nuclear RNAs in oocytes and embryos of Xenopus laevis,1984,Douglass J Forbes and Marc W Kirschner and Daniel Caput and James E Dahlberg and Elsebet Lund,"The small nuclear RNA, U1, is a highly conserved, 165 nucleotide long RNA which has been implicated in the processing of mRNA precursors. We present evidence that in the amphibian X. laevis there exist at least seven species of U1 RNA, which differ in sequence but not in length. Strikingly, these RNAs are not coordinately expressed. Two of the U1 RNAs are the predominant U1 species transcribed in the late blastula-early gastrula stages of Xenopus embryogenesis. These two RNAs, designated xU1a and xU1b, are not synthesized in significant amounts in stage 6 oocytes; a different set of U1 RNAs are expressed during late oogenesis. In a Xenopus cultured cell line, all of the U1 RNA species are expressed. Possible functions and developmental significance of these multiple U1 RNA species are discussed."
206,Quantitative electron microscopy of microtubule assembly in vitro,1975,Marc W Kirschner and Lawrence S Honig and Robley C Williams,"The kinetics of microtubule assembly from purified porcine brain tubulin were examined by quantitative electron microscopy. Assembly at 37° C was initiated by the addition of GTP to 1 m m to the protein solution at∼ 1 mg/ml in ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6· 4. A solution of partially polymerized protein was mixed with a suspension of tomato bushy stunt virus at known particle concentration, and spray-deposited, in negative stain, upon specimen films. The resulting drop patterns were micrographed and the percent protein seen in distinguishable polymeric forms was calculated from the numbers, lengths, and known masses and mass/unit lengths of these entities. Clumping of protein by the uranyl acetate stain was avoided by use of a dual nebulizer which mixed protein and stain only upon spray droplet formation. The micrographs displayed ring-like forms, microtubules, and aggregates of parallel protofilaments …"
207,Subunit treadmilling of microtubules or actin in the presence of cellular barriers: possible conversion of chemical free energy into mechanical work,1982,Terrell L Hill and Marc W Kirschner,"Free microtubule or actin filaments, along with the monomeric forms of the protein, hydrolyze GTP or ATP to produce a flux of subunits through the polymer. This flux, called treadmilling, produces no useful work. In the cell, however, these filaments are likely to be constrained between nucleating sites and other barriers that will limit polymer growth. We study here the effects of a small compression of the filaments resulting from polymerization against such barriers. If subunits can still exchange at the two ends, treadmilling will take place here as well. Under these conditions, the filament system can do useful work. The free energy of NTP hydrolysis can be used to transport materials, attached to the filament, against a resisting force. This process can in principle take place at high efficiency and bears a resemblance in a bioenergetic sense to the utilization of ATP free energy in muscle contraction. The same general …"
208,"FLEXIQuant: a novel tool for the absolute quantification of proteins, and the simultaneous identification and quantification of potentially modified peptides",2009,Sasha Singh and Michael Springer and Judith Steen and Marc W Kirschner and Hanno Steen,"Measurements of protein abundance and quantitative assessment of multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) within a single protein are increasingly used to understand the control of protein activity, particularly in metazoan cells. General methods of wide applicability and precision/accuracy for quantitative estimation of protein post-translational regulation are lacking. Protein mass spectrometry has evolved from a high-throughput qualitative technique to a potentially general quantitative tool, but there are still serious limitations in dynamic range and coverage. To address some of these limitations, we introduce a novel MS-based quantitative strategy, FLEXIQuant, (Full-Length Expressed Stable Isotope-labeled Proteins for Quantification), which can track changes in relative peptide abundances as a function of PTM, and determine absolute quantity of a protein from its lysate. We examined two subunits of the …"
209,The role of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and a novel regulatory subunit in regulating muscle differentiation and patterning.,1997,Anna Philpott and Elena B Porro and Marc W Kirschner and Li-Huei Tsai,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5, coupled with its activator p35, is required for normal neuronal differentiation and patterning. We have isolated a novel member of the p35 family, Xp35.1, from Xenopus embryos which can activate cdk5. Xp35.1 is expressed in both proliferating and differentiated neural and mesodermal cells and is particularly high in developing somites where cdk5 is also expressed. Using dominant-negative cdk5 (cdk5 DN), we show that cdk5 kinase activity is required for normal somitic muscle development; expression of cdk5 DN results in disruption of somitic muscle patterning, accompanied by stunting of the embryos. Using explants of animal pole tissue from blastula embryos, which will differentiate into mesoderm in response to activin, we show that blocking cdk5 kinase activity down-regulates the expression of the muscle marker muscle actin in response to activin, whereas the pan-mesodermal …"
210,Evidence for a functional role of RNA in centrioles,1977,Steven R Heidemann and Greta Sander and Marc W Kirschner,"Basal bodies, purified from Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena, were exposed to various enzymatic treatments and then assayed for their ability to nucleate aster formation upon injection into eggs of Xenopus laevis. Untreated basal bodies injected into frog eggs act as centrioles and induce the formation of asters.The aster-inducing activity of basal bodies was eliminated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes and ribonucleases. Aster-inducing activity was not affected by DNAase and a number of other enzymes. The effect of proteolytic digestion on aster-inducing activity appeared to be directly correlated with the degree of structural damage to the basal body. Low concentrations of pancreatic ribonuclease A, ribonuclease T1, and S1 nuclease also completely abolished aster-inducing activity, although these enzymes had no effect on basal body structure. Ribonuclease-treated basal bodies remained capable of …"
211,A Xenopus nodal-related gene that acts in synergy with noggin to induce complete secondary axis and notochord formation,1996,KD Lustig and K Kroll and E Sun and R Ramos and H Elmendorf and MW Kirschner,"Using a paracrine assay to screen for signaling proteins that could respecify ectodermal tissue, we isolated a Xenopus gene related to the mouse gene nodal, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily. The gene is expressed in three regions in the early Xenopus embryo: first in the gastrula organizer, then in two stripes of cells flanking the posterior notochord in late neurulae, and finally in lateral plate mesoderm restricted to the left side of tailbud-stage embryos. Ectopic expression of the gene induces muscle formation in ectodermal explants and partial secondary axes in whole embryos. Together with noggin, another secreted protein also present in the organizer, it induces notochord formation in ectodermal explants and complete secondary axes in whole embryos. These results suggest that the nodal-related gene may act together with noggin to induce axial pattern during gastrulation and also may play a role in left …"
212,Characteristics of the polar assembly and disassembly of microtubules observed in vitro by darkfield light microscopy.,1979,Keith Summers and Marc W Kirschner,"We describe here the continuous observations of the polymerization of individual microtubules in vitro by darkfield microscopy. In homogeneous preparations we verify that polymerization can occur onto both ends of microtubules. The assembly of microtubules is polar, with one end growing at three times the rate of the other. The differential rate of elongation can be used to determine the polarity of growth off cellular nucleating centers. We show that the microtubules grow off the proximal end of ciliary axonemes at a growth rate equal to that of the slow growing end of free microtubules, while growth off the distal end proceeds at the same rate as the fast growing end. Applying this technique to microtubule growth from metaphase chromosomes isolated from HeLa and CHO cells, we demonstrate that chromosomes initiate polymerization with the fast growing end facing away from the chromosome nucleation site. The …"
213,Dynamic regulation of the PR-Set7 histone methyltransferase is required for normal cell cycle progression,2010,Shumin Wu and Weiping Wang and Xiangduo Kong and Lauren M Congdon and Kyoko Yokomori and Marc W Kirschner and Judd C Rice,"Although the PR-Set7/Set8/KMT5a histone H4 Lys 20 monomethyltransferase (H4K20me1) plays an essential role in mammalian cell cycle progression, especially during G2/M, it remained unknown how PR-Set7 itself was regulated. In this study, we discovered the mechanisms that govern the dynamic regulation of PR-Set7 during mitosis, and that perturbation of these pathways results in defective mitotic progression. First, we found that PR-Set7 is phosphorylated at Ser 29 (S29) specifically by the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1)/cyclinB complex, primarily from prophase through early anaphase, subsequent to global accumulation of H4K20me1. While S29 phosphorylation did not affect PR-Set7 methyltransferase activity, this event resulted in the removal of PR-Set7 from mitotic chromosomes. S29 phosphorylation also functions to stabilize PR-Set7 by directly inhibiting its interaction with the anaphase-promoting …"
214,A general lack of compensation for gene dosage in yeast,2010,Michael Springer and Jonathan S Weissman and Marc W Kirschner,"Gene copy number variation has been discovered in humans, between related species, and in different cancer tissues, but it is unclear how much of this genomic‐level variation leads to changes in the level of protein abundance. To address this, we eliminated one of the two genomic copies of 730 different genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and asked how often a 50% reduction in gene dosage leads to a 50% reduction in protein level. For at least 80% of genes tested, and under several environmental conditions, it does: protein levels in the heterozygous strain are close to 50% of wild type. For <5% of the genes tested, the protein levels in the heterozygote are maintained at nearly wild‐type levels. These experiments show that protein levels are not, in general, directly monitored and adjusted to a desired level. Combined with fitness data, this implies that proteins are expressed at levels higher than necessary for …"
215,CR16 forms a complex with N-WASP in brain and is a novel member of a conserved proline-rich actin-binding protein family,2001,Hsin-Yi Henry Ho and Rajat Rohatgi and Le Ma and Marc W Kirschner,"The Neuronal Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) has emerged  as a central regulator of the actin cytoskeleton with abilities to  integrate multiple upstream signal inputs and transmit them to the  Arp2/3 complex. Here, we demonstrate that native N-WASP is present in  a tight complex with a proline-rich protein, CR16, which shares ≈25%  identity with WASP interacting protein. CR16 is encoded by a gene  previously cloned as a glucocorticoid-regulated mRNA from a rat  hippocampal cDNA library. Although N-WASP is expressed ubiquitously,  full-length CR16 protein is found predominately in the brain. CR16 and  N-WASP colocalize in primary hippocampal neurons and at the tips of  their growth cone filopodia. In vitro, CR16 directly  binds both monomeric and filamentous actin but does not affect the  kinetics of actin polymerization mediated by N-WASP and the Arp2/3  complex. Sequence homologues of …"
216,A dispersed multigene family encoding tubulin in Drosophila melanogaster,1980,Federico Sánchez and Jeanette E Natzle and Don W Cleveland and Marc W Kirschner and Brian J McCarthy,"We have used cloned chicken cDNA sequences for α- and β-tubulin to investigate tubulin gene organization in Drosophila melanogaster. Experiments using genomic Drosophila DNA from several sources indicate that there are at least four copies each of the α-tubulin gene and the β-tubulin gene. In situ hybridization experiments show that both the α- and β-tubulin multigene families have dispersed arrangements on the chromosome. Genes for α-tubulin have been localized at chromosomal bands 67C, 84B/C, 84D and 85E, while genes for β-tubulin have been detected at bands 60A/B and 85D. α-Tubulin and β-tubulin chicken cDNA sequences can be used to select a specific mRNA species from a complex mixture which translates in vitro into α- or β-tubulin protein. RNA blot hybridization using the cloned chicken cDNA sequences as probes shows that the α- and β-tubulin messages detected are clearly different …"
217,Inhibition of cdc2 activation by INH/PP2A.,1994,TH Lee and C Turck and MW Kirschner,"INH, a type 2A protein phosphatase (PP2A), negatively regulates entry into M phase and the cyclin B-dependent activation of cdc2 in Xenopus extracts. INH appears to be central to the mechanism of the trigger for mitotic initiation, as it prevents the premature activation of cdc2. We first show that INH is a conventional form of PP2A with a B alpha regulatory subunit. We next explore the mechanism by which it inhibits cdc2 activation by examining the effect of purified PP2A on the reaction pathways controlling cdc2 activity. Our results suggest that although PP2A inhibits the switch in tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase activities accompanying mitosis, this switch is a consequence of the inhibition of some other rate-limiting event. In the preactivation phase, PP2A inhibits the pathway leading to T161 phosphorylation, suggesting that this activity may be one of the rate-limiting events for transition. However, our …"
218,Aggregation of microtubule initiation sites preceding neurite outgrowth in mouse neuroblastoma cells,1979,Bruce M Spiegelman and Margaret A Lopata and Marc W Kirschner,"By examining microtubule regrowth using immunofluorescence with antibody to tubulin, we have studied the structure and intracellular localization of microtubule initiation sites in undifferentiated and differentiated mouse neuroblastoma cells. The undifferentiated cells are round and lack cell processes. They contain an average of 12 initiation sites per cell. Each of these sites, which are located near the cell nucleus, initiates the growth of several microtubules in a radial formation. In contrast to the undifferentiated cells, neuroblastoma cells stimulated to differentiate by serum deprivation are asymmetrical, containing one or two very long neurites. These cells have a single, large microtubule initiation center which can be visualized not only by immunofluorescence but by phase-contrast and differential interference microscopy as well. The initiation site measures 3–4 μ in diameter and is located in the cell body along a …"
219,Respective roles of centrosomes and chromatin in the conversion of microtubule arrays from interphase to metaphase.,1984,Eric Karsenti and John Newport and Marc Kirschner,"We report the results of studies in which partially purified centrosomes, nuclei, and DNA were injected into frog's eggs, which are naturally arrested in metaphase or interphase. These results have led to an independent assessment of the contributions of the centrosome and the chromatin to the formation of the mitotic spindle and suggest a simple explanation for the transition from interphase to metaphase microtubule arrays."
220,Kinetic responses of β-catenin specify the sites of Wnt control,2012,Ana R Hernández and Allon M Klein and Marc W Kirschner,"Despite more than 30 years of work on the Wnt signaling pathway, the basic mechanism of how the extracellular Wnt signal increases the intracellular concentration of β-catenin is still contentious. Circumventing much of the detailed biochemistry, we used basic principles of chemical kinetics coupled with quantitative measurements to define the reactions on β-catenin directly affected by the Wnt signal. We conclude that the core signal transduction mechanism is relatively simple, with only two regulated phosphorylation steps. Their partial inhibition gives rise to the full dynamics of the response and subsequently maintains a steady state in which the concentration of β-catenin is increased."
221,Structural basis for dynamic regulation of the human 26S proteasome,2016,Shuobing Chen and Jiayi Wu and Ying Lu and Yong-Bei Ma and Byung-Hoon Lee and Zhou Yu and Qi Ouyang and Daniel J Finley and Marc W Kirschner and Youdong Mao,"The proteasome is the major engine of protein degradation in all eukaryotic cells. At the heart of this machine is a heterohexameric ring of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins that unfolds ubiquitylated target proteins that are concurrently translocated into a proteolytic chamber and degraded into peptides. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we determined a near–atomic-resolution structure of the 2.5-MDa human proteasome in its ground state, as well as subnanometer-resolution structures of the holoenzyme in three alternative conformational states. The substrate-unfolding AAA-ATPase channel is narrowed by 10 inward-facing pore loops arranged into two helices that run in parallel with each other, one hydrophobic in character and the other highly charged. The gate of the core particle was unexpectedly found closed in the ground state and open in only one of the alternative states …"
222,A novel set of Wnt-Frizzled fusion proteins identifies receptor components that activate β-catenin-dependent signaling,2002,Sheri L Holmen and Adrian Salic and Cassandra R Zylstra and Marc W Kirschner and Bart O Williams,"Wnt proteins initiate the canonical (β-catenin-regulated) signaling cascade by binding to seven-transmembrane spanning receptors of the Frizzled (Fz) family together with the coreceptors LRP5 and -6, members of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family (LRP). Several reports have shown physical and functional associations between various Wnt, LRP, and Frizzled molecules; however, the underlying mechanisms for selectivity remain poorly understood. We present data on a novel set of Wnt-Fz fusion constructs that are useful for elucidating mechanisms of Wnt signal transduction specificity in both Xenopus embryos and 293T cells. In 293T cells, coexpression of several Wnt-Fz fusion proteins with LRP6, but not LRP5, significantly activated a Wnt-responsive promoter, Optimized TOPFlash. Interestingly, Wnt proteins from both the Wnt1 and Wnt5A classes, when fused to the same Frizzled, can …"
223,Phosphorylation changes associated with the early cell cycle in Xenopus eggs,1987,Eric Karsenti and Rodrigo Bravo and Marc Kirschner,"Enucleated and nondividing amphibian eggs undergo cyclic changes in cell morphology and in the level of maturation promoting factor (MPF) with a period similar to the early cleavage cycle. We show here that there is a corresponding phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific proteins associated with this fundamental cell cycle. M-phase is associated with a general increase in phosphatase activity and specific phosphorylation of a small set of M-phase proteins, reflected in an increased stochiometry of phosphate and increased turnover. At the end of metaphase and correlated with a drop in MPF the phosphoproteins are rapidly lost. By microinjecting M-phase phosphoproteins into arrested interphase and metaphase eggs we could show that the specific M-phase phosphorylation was not due to specificity in phosphatase action. The ability to segregate synthesis from phosphorylation demonstrates that …"
224,"Specific proteolysis of the kinase protein kinase C-related kinase 2 by caspase-3 during apoptosis: Identification by a novel, small pool expression cloning strategy",1997,Vincent L Cryns and Youngsup Byun and Ajay Rana and Harry Mellor and Kevin D Lustig and Louis Ghanem and Peter J Parker and Marc W Kirschner and Junying Yuan,"The caspase family of proteases plays a critical role in the execution of apoptosis. However, efforts to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which caspases induce cell death have been greatly hindered by the lack of systematic and broadly applicable strategies to identify their substrates. Here we describe a novel expression cloning strategy to rapidly isolate cDNAs encoding caspase substrates that are cleaved during apoptosis. Small cDNA pools (approximately 100 clones each) are transcribed/translatedin vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine; these labeled protein pools are then incubated with cytosolic extracts from control and apoptotic cells. cDNA pools encoding proteins that are specifically cleaved by the apoptotic extract and whose cleavage is prevented by the caspase inhibitor acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp chloromethylketone are subdivided and retested until a single cDNA is isolated. Using this approach …"
225,The timing of early developmental events in Xenopus,1985,M Kirschner and J Newport and J Gerhart,"The eggs of animals undergo carefully timed sequences of events controlled by endogenous timing mechanisms. Recent studies in Xenopus have revealed three timing mechanisms based on different principles. The early synchronous cleavage cycle is based on a cytoplasmic oscillator present in each blastomere, which can operate independently of the nuclear events which it controls. The cessation of synchronous cleavage at the midblastula transition engages a new developmental program. The timing of this transition depends on the nucleus-to-cytoplasm volume ratio, which is sensed by the titration of some material by the nucleus. Following the midblastula transition is gastrulation, whose timing is sensed not by the nucleus to cytoplasm ratio but by time elapsed since fertilization. The Xenopus egg therefore possesses long-term timing mechanisms which initiate and engage new developmental programs."
226,Two tandem verprolin homology domains are necessary for a strong activation of Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization and induction of microspike formation by N-WASP,2000,Hideki Yamaguchi and Hiroaki Miki and Shiro Suetsugu and Le Ma and Marc W Kirschner and Tadaomi Takenawa,"All WASP family proteins share a common C terminus that consists of  the verprolin homology domain (V), cofilin homology domain (C), and  acidic region (A), through which they activate Arp2/3 complex-induced  actin polymerization. In this study, we characterized the Arp2/3  complex-mediated actin polymerization activity of VCA fragments of all  of the WASP family proteins: WASP, N-WASP, WAVE1, WAVE2, and WAVE3. All  of the VCA fragments stimulated the nucleating activity of Arp2/3  complex. Among them, N-WASP VCA, which possesses two tandem V motifs,  had a more potent activity than other VCA proteins. The chimeric  protein experiments revealed that the V motif was more important to the  activation potency than the CA region; two V motifs were required for  full activity of N-WASP. COS7 cells overexpressing N-WASP form  microspikes in response to epidermal growth factor. However, when a …"

228,Autoregulation of tubulin synthesis in enucleated cells,1985,Joan M Caron and Albert L Jones and Leslie B Rall and MW Kirschner,"The effects on tubulin messenger RNA levels and tubulin protein synthesis of treating cells with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs or directly microinjecting cells with tubulin have suggested that non-polymerized tubulin depresses its own synthesis 1–4. The precise level of this control is unclear. It has been shown that enucleated cells, termed cytoplasts, retain many properties of the original cell, including maintenance of cell shape, pinocytic activity and locomotion 5 as well as biosynthetic activities such as protein synthesis 6, 7 and replication of cytoplasmic viruses 8. Furthermore, cytoplasts retain most of the components of the cytoskeleton including the centrioles 5, 9. If cytoplasmic activities alone are responsible for regulating tubulin biosynthesis, cytoplasts should contain the necessary components. To distinguish between regulation which would occur in the nucleus, that is, alterations in mRNA synthesis or …"

230,Hemichordates and the origin of chordates,2005,John Gerhart and Christopher Lowe and Marc Kirschner,"Hemichordates, the phylum of bilateral animals most closely related to chordates, could reveal the evolutionary origins of chordate traits such as the nerve cord, notochord, gill slits and tail. The anteroposterior maps of gene expression domains for 38 genes of chordate neural patterning are highly similar for hemichordates and chordates, even though hemichordates have a diffuse nerve-net. About 40% of the domains are not present in protostome maps. We propose that this map, the gill slits and the tail date to the deuterostome ancestor. The map of dorsoventral expression domains, centered on a Bmp–Chordin axis, differs between the two groups; hemichordates resemble protostomes more than they do chordates. The dorsoventral axis might have undergone extensive modification in the chordate line, including centralization of the nervous system, segregation of epidermis, derivation of the notochord, and an …"
231,A new lamin in Xenopus somatic tissues displays strong homology to human lamin A.,1987,Sandra L Wolin and G Krohne and MW Kirschner,"The nuclear lamina of vertebrates is composed of several major polypeptides that range in mol. wt from 60 to 80 kd. In mammals, the three major lamin proteins are designated A, B and C. Two major lamins have been described in Xenopus somatic tissues; two other lamins are expressed primarily in germ cells. We have analysed a cDNA clone encoding a Xenopus lamin that is highly homologous to human lamins A and C. The predicted protein has the carboxy‐terminal domain characteristic of human lamin A and is thus a lamin A homologue. Surprisingly, the lamin encoded by the cDNA clone is not one of the known Xenopus lamins. The encoded protein is distinct in size from the oocyte lamin LIII and the two somatic lamins LI and LII. Monoclonal antibodies specific for LII, LIII and LIV (the lamin of male germ cells) do not recognize the protein encoded by the cDNA clone; conversely, a polyclonal antibody against …"
232,Accurate multiplexed proteomics at the MS2 level using the complement reporter ion cluster,2012,Martin Wühr and Wilhelm Haas and Graeme C McAlister and Leonid Peshkin and Ramin Rad and Marc W Kirschner and Steven P Gygi,"Isobaric labeling strategies, such as isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) or tandem mass tags (TMT), have promised to dramatically increase the power of quantitative proteomics. However, when applied to complex mixtures, both the accuracy and precision are undermined by interfering peptide ions that coisolate and cofragment with the target peptide. Additional gas-phase isolation steps, such as proton-transfer ion–ion reactions (PTR) or higher-order MS3 scans, can almost completely eliminate this problem. Unfortunately, these methods come at the expense of decreased acquisition speed and sensitivity. Here we present a method that allows accurate quantification of TMT-labeled peptides at the MS2 level without additional ion purification. Quantification is based on the fragment ion cluster that carries most of the TMT mass balance. In contrast to the use of low m/z reporter ions, the …"
233,Intracellular proteolysis,1999,Marc Kirschner,"Our present understanding of intracellular protein degradation developed from an attempt to understand the metabolic stability of proteins in cells. With the unravelling of its complex biochemical machinery has come a realization that protein degradation plays an important role in the most crucial events in the cell cycle, in signal transduction and in maintaining the integrity of the proper folded state of proteins. In this review, I attempt to trace the curious history of intracellular protein degradation, its novel and elegant biochemistry and to extract the features that might be important for the next era of studies in cell physiology."
234,The mechanism of microtubule assembly in vitro,1974,Marc W Kirschner and Robley C Williams,"The mechanism of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization has been studied with protein purified from extracts of porcine brain. Under polymerizing conditions characteristic microtubules composed of parallel protofilaments are observed in the electron microscope. Under depolymerizing conditions three forms are observed: double rings of outside diameter 49 nm, spirals, and 7‐nm globular subunits. Under the same conditions two boundaries are observed in the analytical ultracentrifuge at 6S and 36S, whether depolymerization is accomplished by cooling to 0°C, by addition of 1 mM CaCl2 at 25°C, or by removal of GTP. On polymerization all of the 36S and most of the 6S is converted to a fast‐sedimenting form which the electron microscope reveals to be microtubules.The depolymerization mixture may be fractionated by gel chromatography into two fractions, one consisting solely of 6S and the other …"
236,[26] Isolation of mammalian centrosomes,1986,TJ Mitchison and MW Kirschner,"The centrosome is the principal microtubule-organizing center in animal cells in interphase. J It usually consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by ill-defined fibrous or amorphous pericentriolar material, and this latter component is responsible for microtubule nucleation. 2 Little is known about the chemistry of this organelle, except that the centriole cylinders are constructed from triplet microtubules. Isolated centrosomes are potentially useful for chemical and structural studies of the organelle. In addition they can serve as nucleating centers for astral arrays of microtubules of known polarity) Such organized arrays may provide a useful substrate for studying diverse aspects of microtubule behavior and func-1 j.

SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SMURF1) belongs to the Nedd4 family of HECT ubiquitin ligases that directly catalyzes ubiquitin conjugation onto diverse substrates. As a result, SMURF1 regulates a great variety of cellular physiologies including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, cell migration, and planar cell polarity. Structurally, SMURF1 consists of a C2 domain, two WW domain repeats, and a catalytic HECT domain essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This modular architecture allows for interactions with other proteins, which are either substrates or adaptors of SMURF1. Despite the increasing number of SMURF1 substrates identified, current knowledge regarding regulatory proteins and their modes of action on controlling SMURF1 activity is still limited. In this study, we employed …"
238,Small nuclear RNA transcription and ribonucleoprotein assembly in early Xenopus development.,1983,Douglass J Forbes and Thomas B Kornberg and Marc W Kirschner,"The Xenopus egg and embryo, throughout the transcriptionally inactive early cleavage period, were found to contain a store of approximately 8 X 10(8) molecules of the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U1, sufficient for 4,000-8,000 nuclei. In addition, when transcription is activated at the twelfth cleavage (4,000 cell-stage), the snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 are major RNA polymerase II products. From the twelfth cleavage to gastrulation, U1 RNA increases sevenfold in 4 h, paralleling a similar increase in nuclear number. This level of snRNA transcription is much greater than that typical of somatic cells, implying a higher rate of U1 transcription or a greater number of U1 genes active in the embryo. The Xenopus egg also contains snRNP proteins, since it has the capacity to package exogenously added snRNA into immunoprecipitable snRNP particles, which resemble endogenous particles in both sedimentation …"
239,Isolation of separate mRNAs for α-and β-tubulin and characterization of the corresponding in vitro translation products,1978,Don W Cleveland and Marc W Kirschner and Nicholas J Cowan,"The messenger RNAs coding for α- and β-tubulin have been isolated from embryonic chick brain. Although the mRNAs for the two tubulin subunits have been resolved on native gels, they are very similar in molecular weight (650,000 daltons) as judged by mobility on denaturing gels containing methyl mercury. The mRNAs for β- and γ-actin have also been resolved on native gels, but migrate as an unresolved peak (molecular weight 650,000–700,000 daltons) under denaturing conditions. Since the nonmuscle actins are substantially smaller proteins than α- and β-tubulin, the large size of chick nonmuscle actin mRNAs suggests an unusually long untranslated region.Since tubulin and actin polypeptides are internal structural proteins, one would expect them to be synthesized only on free polysomes. Translation of mRNA derived directly from a purified membrane fraction or by puromycin release from that fraction …"
240,Cell cycle adaptations of embryonic stem cells,2011,Andrea Ballabeni and In-Hyun Park and Rui Zhao and Weiping Wang and Paul H Lerou and George Q Daley and Marc W Kirschner,"ES cells proliferate with very short gap phases yet maintain their capacity to differentiate. It had been thought that the levels of cyclins and other substrates of ubiquitin ligase APC/C remain nearly constant and Cdk activity remains constitutively high in mouse ES cells. Here we demonstrate that APC/C (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome) enzyme is active in ES cells but attenuated by high levels of the Emi1 (early mitotic inhibitor-1) protein. Despite the presence of high Cdk activity during the G1 phase, chromatin can be effectively licensed for DNA replication and fast entry into the S phase can still occur. High Cdk activity during S-G2-M phases produces high levels of the DNA replication factor Cdt1, and this leads to efficient Mcm proteins loading on chromatin after mitotic exit. Although disturbing the usual balance between Cdk activity and APC/C activity found in somatic cells, a few key adaptations allow …"
241,Association of tau protein with microtubules in living cells,1986,David Drubin and Sumire Kobayashi and Marc Kirschner,"Several well-characterized microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) coassemble with microtubules in vitro and promote the assembly of purified tubulin. These include the tau proteins of 55,000-68,000 kD,'-* MAPs of 120,000 and 210,000 kD, 3 and MAPs of approximately 300,000 kD, called MAP-1 and MAP-2.4-6 The relevance of in vitro studies on MAPs rests first upon direct demonstration that the MAPs associate with microtubules in living cells, and second upon direct demonstration of their in vivo functions. Immunocytochemical studies have supported the conclusion that tau,'-'the 210,000 kD MAP: and the 300,000 kD MAPs'*~@'~ bind microtubules in living cells. Immunocytochemical experiments alone, however, can be ambiguous, as evidenced by inconsistencies in reported staining patterns. For example, in our own studies with a highly specific affinity-purified antiserum raised against bovine brain tau …"
242,A chemical inhibitor of N-WASP reveals a new mechanism for targeting protein interactions,2001,Jeffrey R Peterson and R Scott Lokey and Timothy J Mitchison and Marc W Kirschner,"Cell morphology and motility are governed largely by complex signaling networks that ultimately engage the actin cytoskeleton. Understanding how individual circuits contribute to the process of forming cellular structures would be aided greatly by the availability of specific chemical inhibitors. We have used a novel chemical screen in Xenopus cell-free extracts to identify compounds that inhibit signaling pathways regulating actin polymerization. Here we report the results of a high-throughput screen for compounds that inhibit phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-induced actin assembly and the identification of the first compound, a cyclic peptide, known to block actin assembly by inhibiting an upstream signaling component. We identify the target of this compound as N-WASP, a protein that has been investigated for its role as a node interconnecting various actin signaling networks. We show that this …"
243,Multiple sites for the initiation of microtubule assembly in mammalian cells,1979,Bruce M Spiegelman and Margaret A Lopata and Marc W Kirschner,"The pattern of microtubule regrowth in mammalian fibroblast and epithelial cells has been examined by immunofluorescence of cytoskeletal preparations with antibody to tubulin. After reversal of treatment with colcemid, vinblastine or low temperature, microtubules appear to grow simultaneously from several distinct initiation sites located within 5 μ of the nucleus of mouse and human fibroblasts. Each site initiates the growth of 10–30 microtubules. More than 70% of the mouse fibroblasts have between 5 and 10 initiation sites with an average of 8. The human fibroblasts have an average of 5 sites per cell. The average number and numerical distribution of sites per fibroblast cell are not affected by time of exposure to colcemid or the concentration of colcemid applied to the cells.

E2 and RING E3 enzymes often collaborate to first prime a substrate with a single ubiquitin (UB) and then achieve different forms of polyubiquitination: multiubiquitination of several sites and elongation of linkage-specific UB chains. Here, cryo-EM and biochemistry show that the human E3 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its two partner E2s, UBE2C (aka UBCH10) and UBE2S, adopt specialized catalytic architectures for these two distinct forms of polyubiquitination. The APC/C RING constrains UBE2C proximal to a substrate and simultaneously binds a substrate-linked UB to drive processive multiubiquitination. Alternatively, during UB chain elongation, the RING does not bind UBE2S but rather lures an evolving substrate-linked UB to UBE2S positioned through a cullin interaction to generate a Lys11-linked chain. Our findings …"
245,Quantitative reconstitution of mitotic CDK1 activation in somatic cell extracts,2010,Richard W Deibler and Marc W Kirschner,"The regulation of mitotic entry in somatic cells differs from embryonic cells, yet it is only for embryonic cells that we have a quantitative understanding of this process. To gain a similar insight into somatic cells, we developed a human cell extract system that recapitulates CDK1 activation and nuclear envelope breakdown in response to mitotic cyclins. As cyclin B concentrations increase, CDK1 activates in a three-stage nonlinear response, creating an ordering of substrate phosphorylations. This response is established by dual regulatory feedback loops involving WEE1/MYT1, which impose a cyclin B threshold, and CDC25, which allows CDK1 to escape the WEE1/MYT1 inhibition. This system also exhibits a complex response to cyclin A. Cyclin A promotes WEE1 phosphorylation to weaken the negative feedback loop and primes mitotic entry through cyclin B. This observation explains the requirement of both cyclin A …"
246,Transient expression and heat‐stress‐inducedco‐aggregation of endogenous and heterologous small heat‐stress proteins in tobacco protoplasts,2000,Marc Kirschner and Sybille Winkelhaus and Jörg M Thierfelder and Lutz Nover,"Heat‐stress granules (HSG) are highly ordered, cytoplasmic chaperone complexes found in all heat‐stressed plant cells. We have developed an experimental system involving expression of cytosolic class I and class II small heat‐stress proteins (Hsps) of pea, Arabidopsis and tomato in tobacco protoplasts to study the structural prerequisites for the assembly of HSG or HSG‐like complexes. Class I and class II small Hsps formed class‐specific dodecamers of 210–280 kDa, which, upon heat stress, were incorporated into HSG complexes. Interestingly, class II dodecamers alone could form HSG‐like complexes (auto‐aggregation), whereas class I dodecamers could do so only in the presence of class II proteins (recruitment). By analysing C‐terminal deletion forms of Hsp17 class II, we obtained evidence that the intact C‐terminus is critical for the oligomerization state, for the heat‐stress‐induced auto …"
247,The redistribution of a conserved nuclear envelope protein during the cell cycle suggests a pathway for chromosome condensation,1984,Frank D McKeon and Denny L Tuffanelli and Sumire Kobayashi and Marc W Kirschner,"We describe a human autoantiserum that recognizes specific determinants present both on the nuclear envelope of interphase cells and the periphery of metaphase chromosomes. These determinants are highly conserved through evolution and present on a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 33,000. This 33 kd protein, which we call “perichromin,” appears to be directly or indirectly bound to both interphase and metaphase DNA. Studies of the transformation of perichromin from a nuclear envelope association to a perichromosomal position during prophase suggests a pathway for chromosome organization throughout the cell cycle."
248,The Gonium pectorale genome demonstrates co-option of cell cycle regulation during the evolution of multicellularity,2016,Erik R Hanschen and Tara N Marriage and Patrick J Ferris and Takashi Hamaji and Atsushi Toyoda and Asao Fujiyama and Rafik Neme and Hideki Noguchi and Yohei Minakuchi and Masahiro Suzuki and Hiroko Kawai-Toyooka and David R Smith and Halle Sparks and Jaden Anderson and Robert Bakarić and Victor Luria and Amir Karger and Marc W Kirschner and Pierre M Durand and Richard E Michod and Hisayoshi Nozaki and Bradley JSC Olson,"The transition to multicellularity has occurred numerous times in all domains of life, yet its initial steps are poorly understood. The volvocine green algae are a tractable system for understanding the genetic basis of multicellularity including the initial formation of cooperative cell groups. Here we report the genome sequence of the undifferentiated colonial alga, Gonium pectorale, where group formation evolved by co-option of the retinoblastoma cell cycle regulatory pathway. Significantly, expression of the Gonium retinoblastoma cell cycle regulator in unicellular Chlamydomonas causes it to become colonial. The presence of these changes in undifferentiated Gonium indicates extensive group-level adaptation during the initial step in the evolution of multicellularity. These results emphasize an early and formative step in the evolution of multicellularity, the evolution of cell cycle regulation, one that may shed light on …"
249,The nuclear proteome of a vertebrate,2015,Martin Wühr and Thomas Güttler and Leonid Peshkin and Graeme C McAlister and Matthew Sonnett and Keisuke Ishihara and Aaron C Groen and Marc Presler and Brian K Erickson and Timothy J Mitchison and Marc W Kirschner and Steven P Gygi,"The composition of the nucleoplasm determines the behavior of key processes such as transcription, yet there is still no reliable and quantitative resource of nuclear proteins. Furthermore, it is still unclear how the distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic compositions are maintained. To describe the nuclear proteome quantitatively, we isolated the large nuclei of frog oocytes via microdissection and measured the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of ∼9,000 proteins by mass spectrometry. Most proteins localize entirely to either nucleus or cytoplasm; only ∼17% partition equally. A protein’s native size in a complex, but not polypeptide molecular weight, is predictive of localization: partitioned proteins exhibit native sizes larger than ∼100 kDa, whereas natively smaller proteins are equidistributed. To evaluate the role of nuclear export in maintaining localization, we inhibited Exportin 1. This resulted in the expected re-localization …"
250,Control of mitotic transitions by the anaphase–promoting complex,1999,Guowei Fang and Hongtao Yu and W Kirschner,"Proteolysis controls key transitions at several points in the cell cycle. In mitosis, the activation of a large ubiquitin–protein ligase, the anaphase–promoting complex (APC), is required for anaphase initiation and for exit from mitosis. We show that APC is under complex control by a network of regulatory factors, CDC20, CDH1 and MAD2. CDC20 and CDH1 are activators of APC; they bind directly to APC and activate its cyclin ubiquitination activity. CDC20 activates APC at the onset of anaphase in a destruction box (DB)–dependent manner, while CDH1 activates APC from late anaphase through G1 with apparently a much relaxed specificity for the DB. Therefore, CDC20 and CDH1 control both the temporal order of activation and the substrate specificity of APC, and hence regulate different events during mitosis and G1. Counteracting the effect of CDC20, the checkpoint protein MAD2 acts as an inhibitor of APC. When …"
251,"Small pool expression screening: identification of genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and early development",1997,Kevin D Lustig and P Todd Stukenberg and Thomas J McGarry and Randall W King and Vincent L Cryns and Paul E Mead and Leonard I Zon and Junying Yuan and Marc W Kirschner,"This chapter discusses the identification of genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and early development. Traditional genetic and biochemical methods have been quite successful in identifying genes that are essential for cell cycle progression and early embryonic development, among other diverse biological processes. Nevertheless, only a small fraction of the genes in the vertebrate genome has been functionally characterized. This chapter describes a systematic and broadly applicable approach to cloning genes based solely on the biological activities or biochemical properties of the gene products. It describes several potential applications of this expression cloning approach, and also discusses its use in related types of screening procedures. It describes general methods used to prepare library pools of cDNA, RNA, and protein, and the sib selection techniques used to subdivide a …"
252,Large-scale detection of ubiquitination substrates using cell extracts and protein microarrays,2009,Yifat Merbl and Marc W Kirschner,"Identification of protein targets of post-translational modification is an important analytical problem in biology. Protein microarrays exposed to cellular extracts could offer a rapid and convenient means of identifying modified proteins, but this kind of biochemical assay, unlike DNA microarrays, depends on a faithful reconstruction of in vivo conditions. Over several years, concentrated cellular extracts have been developed, principally for cell cycle studies that reproduce very complex cellular states. We have used extracts that replicate the mitotic checkpoint and anaphase release to identify differentially regulated poyubiquitination. Protein microarrays were exposed to these complex extracts, and the polyubiquitinated products were detected by specific antibodies. We expected that among the substrates revealed by the microarray should be substrates of the anaphase promoting complex (APC). Among 8,000 proteins …"
253,Proteolysis and DNA replication: the CDC34 requirement in the Xenopus egg cell cycle,1997,P Renee Yew and Marc W Kirschner,"The cell division cycle gene, CDC34, is required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of G1 regulators and cell cycle progression through the transition from G1 to S phase in budding yeast. A CDC34 requirement for S phase onset in higher eukaryotes has not been established. Studies of the simple embryonic cell cycle of Xenopus laevis eggs demonstrated that Cdc34p in a large molecular size complex was required in the initiation of DNA replication. Cdc34p appears to regulate the initiation function of Cdk2–cyclin E, perhaps through the degradation of the Xenopus cdk inhibitor, Xic1."
254,Initiation of the cell cycle and establishment of bilateral symmetry in Xenopus eggs,1980,Marc Kirschner and John C Gerhart and Koki Hara and Geertje A Ubbels,"This chapter discusses the initiation of the cell cycle and establishment of bilateral symmetry in Xenopus egg. In the establishment of the cell cycle, in unfertilized Xenopus laevis eggs the cell cycle is arrested at second meiotic metaphase where no DNA synthesis is taking place. The period after fertilization in amphibian eggs is concerned with the completion of meiosis, fusion of the pronuclei, restarting the cell cycle, and the establishment of the dorsal–ventral asymmetry of the future embryo. Directly after fertilization there are a number of cortical and internal movements that are related to these events. Fertilized Xenopus eggs when rotated, sperm entrance point (SEP) down acquire the same yolk configuration as do unrotated eggs, that is, vitelline wall on the dorsal side, whereas Xenopus eggs rotated with the SEP up, acquire a mirror image configuration of vegetal yolk. Thus, the …"
255,APCCdc20 suppresses apoptosis through targeting Bim for ubiquitination and destruction,2014,Lixin Wan and Mingjia Tan and Jie Yang and Hiroyuki Inuzuka and Xiangpeng Dai and Tao Wu and Jia Liu and Shavali Shaik and Guoan Chen and Jing Deng and Marcos Malumbres and Anthony Letai and Marc W Kirschner and Yi Sun and Wenyi Wei,"Anaphase-promoting complex Cdc20 (APCCdc20) plays pivotal roles in governing mitotic progression. By suppressing APCCdc20, antimitotic agents activate the spindle-assembly checkpoint and induce apoptosis after prolonged treatment, whereas depleting endogenous Cdc20 suppresses tumorigenesis in part by triggering mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying apoptosis induced by Cdc20 abrogation remains poorly understood. Here, we report the BH3-only proapoptotic protein Bim as an APCCdc20 target, such that depletion of Cdc20 sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli. Strikingly, Cdc20 and multiple APC-core components were identified in a small interfering RNA screen that, upon knockdown, sensitizes otherwise resistant cancer cells to chemoradiation in a Bim-dependent manner. Consistently, human adult T cell leukemia cells that acquire elevated …"
256,β-catenin specifies the endomesoderm and defines the posterior organizer of the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii,2011,Sébastien Darras and John Gerhart and Mark Terasaki and Marc Kirschner and Christopher J Lowe,"The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a key regulator of body plan organization and axis formation in metazoans, being involved in germ layer specification, posterior growth and patterning of the anteroposterior axis. Results from animals spanning a wide phylogenetic range suggest that a unifying function of β-catenin in metazoans is to define the posterior/vegetal part of the embryo. Although the specification of vegetal territories (endoderm) by β-catenin has been demonstrated in distantly related animals (cnidarians, a protostome, echinoderms and ascidians), the definition of the posterior part of the embryo is well supported only for vertebrates and planarians. To gain insights into β-catenin functions during deuterostome evolution, we have studied the early development of the direct developing hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. We show that the zygote is polarized after fertilization along the animal …"
257,A microtubule-binding Rho-GEF controls cell morphology during convergent extension of Xenopus laevis,2005,Kristen M Kwan and Marc W Kirschner,"During Xenopus development, convergent extension movements mediated by cell intercalation drive axial elongation. While many genes required for convergent extension have been identified, little is known of regulation of the cytoskeleton during these cell movements. Although microtubules are required for convergent extension, this applies only to initial stages of gastrulation, between stages 10 and 10.5. To examine the cytoskeleton more directly during convergent extension, we visualized actin and microtubules simultaneously in live explants using spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscopy. Microtubule depolymerization by nocodazole inhibits lamellipodial protrusions and cell-cell contact, thereby inhibiting convergent extension. However, neither taxol nor vinblastine, both of which block microtubule dynamics while stabilizing a polymer form of tubulin, inhibits lamellipodia or convergent extension. This …"
258,Axonal transport of tubulin in tit pioneer neurons in situ,1995,James Sabry and Tim P O'Connor and Marc W Kirschner,"In neurons, tubulin is synthesized only in the cell body or dendrites, yet the growing axon requires a steady supply of this protein at the growth cone. Hence, some mechanism must exist to move tubulin from the cell body to the growth cone. Transport could conceivably occur by simple diffusion, translocation of polymer, or some form of monomer or oligomer transport. Evidence for all these has been presented in a variety of experimental systems. We have directly studied the movement of microtubules in 12 growing axons in live grasshopper Till neurons in their natural environment by labeling the polymer with a caged fluorophore, biscaged fluorescein. No evidence of polymer transport was found. Hence, tubulin movement in these neurons must occur by movement of monomeric tubulin, either by transport or diffusion. To resolve these conflicting views, we discuss the conditions under which diffusion is feasible as a …"
259,Profiling of ubiquitin-like modifications reveals features of mitotic control,2013,Yifat Merbl and Phillipe Refour and Hevan Patel and Michael Springer and Marc W Kirschner,"Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein modifications affect protein stability, activity, and localization, but we still lack broad understanding of the functions of Ubl modifications. We have profiled the protein targets of ubiquitin and six additional Ubls in mitosis using a functional assay that utilizes active mammalian cell extracts and protein microarrays and identified 1,500 potential substrates; 80–200 protein targets were exclusive to each Ubl. The network structure is nonrandom, with most targets mapping to a single Ubl. There are distinct molecular functions for each Ubl, suggesting divergent biological roles. Analysis of differential profiles between mitosis and G1 highlighted a previously underappreciated role for the Ubl, FAT10, in mitotic regulation. In addition to its role as a resource for Ubl modifications, our study provides a systematic approach to analyze changes in posttranslational modifications at various …"
260,Different phosphorylation states of the anaphase promoting complex in response to antimitotic drugs: a quantitative proteomic analysis,2008,Judith AJ Steen and Hanno Steen and Ann Georgi and Kenneth Parker and Michael Springer and Marc Kirchner and Fred Hamprecht and Marc W Kirschner,"The anaphase promoting complex (APC) controls the degradation of proteins during exit from mitosis and entry into S-phase. The activity of the APC is regulated by phosphorylation during mitosis. Because the phosphorylation pattern provides insights into the complexity of regulation of the APC, we studied in detail the phosphorylation patterns at a single mitotic state of arrest generated by various antimitotic drugs. We examined the phosphorylation patterns of the APC in HeLa S3 cells after they were arrested in prometaphase with taxol, nocodazole, vincristine, or monastrol. There were 71 phosphorylation sites on nine of the APC subunits. Despite the common state of arrest, the various antimitotic drug treatments resulted in differences in the phosphorylation patterns and phosphorylation stoichiometries. The relative phosphorylation stoichiometries were determined by using a method adapted from the isotope-free …"
261,Gap 1 phase length and mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal,2012,Victor C Li and Andrea Ballabeni and Marc W Kirschner,"In somatic cells, the length of the G1 phase of the cell cycle is tightly linked to differentiation, and its elongation can drive differentiation in many cases. Although it has been suggested that the situation is very similar in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where a rapid cell cycle and a short G1 phase maintain the pluripotent state, evidence has been contradictory. Here we show that, in murine ESCs, elongation of the cell cycle and elongation of G1 are compatible with their pluripotent state. Multiple methods that lengthen the cell cycle and that target cyclin-dependent kinase, retinoblastoma protein, and E2F activity all fail to induce differentiation on their own or even to facilitate differentiation. The resistance of murine ESCs to differentiation induced by lengthening G1 and/or the cell cycle could allow for separate control of these events and provide new opportunities for investigation and application."
262,The secreted Frizzled-related protein Sizzled functions as a negative feedback regulator of extreme ventral mesoderm,2003,Licio Collavin and Marc W Kirschner,"The prevailing model of dorsal ventral patterning of the amphibian embryo  predicts that the prospective mesoderm is regionalized at gastrulation in  response to a gradient of signals. This gradient is established by diffusible  BMP and Wnt inhibitors secreted dorsally in the Spemann organizer. An  interesting question is whether ventrolateral tissue passively reads graded  levels of ventralizing signals, or whether local self-organizing regulatory  circuits may exist on the ventral side to control cell behavior and  differentiation at a distance from the Organizer. We provide evidence that  sizzled, a secreted Frizzled-related protein expressed ventrally  during and after gastrulation, functions in a negative feedback loop that  limits allocation of mesodermal cells to the extreme ventral fate, with direct  consequences for morphogenesis and formation of the blood islands.  Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Sizzled protein …"
263,Conservation of microtubule associated proteins. Isolation and characterization of tau and the high molecular weight microtubule associated protein from chicken brain and from …,1979,DW Cleveland and BM Spiegelman and MW Kirschner,"MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Microtubule Protein, Purified Tubulin, and T-Microtubule protein was prepared from porcine or chicken brain by the Weingarten et al.(1974) modification of the method of Shelanski et al.(1973). Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin was prepared by chromatography of microtubule protein as described by Weingarten et al.(1975). After removal of the tubulin, a crude associated protein fraction was obtained by elution of the adsorbed protein with 1.0 M NaCl. This fraction then was desalted on Bio-Gel P6 into Buffer P (0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.4), 1 mrvr ethylene glycol bis (P-aminoethyl ether) N, N’-tetraacetic acid, 0.1 IIIM EDTA, 0.5 mM MgCl,, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Hog 7 was further purified as previously described (Cleveland et al., 197713) by a combination of phosphocellulose chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Chicken 7 was purified in an analogous fashion with the exceptions noted in the text. The ability of associated protein fractions to stimulate assembly of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin was monitored by quantitative electron microscopy as initially described by Kirschner et al.(1975). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(1951), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Hydroxyapatite was purchased from Bio-Rad. Ammonium sulfate (ultrapure) was obtained from Schwarz/Mann and phosphocellulose(Pll, batch 359) was from Whatman."
264,The cell cycle then and now,1992,Marc Kirschner,In the last few years a general model of cell cycle control has been established for all eukaryotic cells. Experiments from a variety of organisms and from a variety of experimental approaches have identified a protein kinase and its unstable regulatory subunit as the activator of mitosis; related molecules seem to be involved in the activation of chromosome replication. The identification of the biochemical components of these important regulatory pathways is providing several new insights into homeostatic and developmental control mechanisms in higher organisms.
265,Size homeostasis in adherent cells studied by synthetic phase microscopy,2013,Yongjin Sung and Amit Tzur and Seungeun Oh and Wonshik Choi and Victor Li and Ramachandra R Dasari and Zahid Yaqoob and Marc W Kirschner,"The coupling of the rate of cell growth to the rate of cell division determines cell size, a defining characteristic that is central to cell function and, ultimately, to tissue architecture. The physiology of size homeostasis has fascinated generations of biologists, but the mechanism, challenged by experimental limitations, remains largely unknown. In this paper, we propose a unique optical method that can measure the dry mass of thick live cells as accurately as that for thin cells with high computational efficiency. With this technique, we quantify, with unprecedented accuracy, the asymmetry of division in lymphoblasts and epithelial cells. We can then use the Collins–Richmond model of conservation to compute the relationship between growth rate and cell mass. In attached epithelial cells, we find that due to the asymmetry in cell division and size-dependent growth rate, there is active regulation of cell size. Thus, like …"
266,Exploiting polypharmacology for drug target deconvolution,2014,Taranjit Singh Gujral and Leonid Peshkin and Marc W Kirschner,"Polypharmacology (action of drugs against multiple targets) represents a tempting avenue for new drug development; unfortunately, methods capable of exploiting the known polypharmacology of drugs for target deconvolution are lacking. Here, we present an ensemble approach using elastic net regularization combined with mRNA expression profiling and previously characterized data on a large set of kinase inhibitors to identify kinases that are important for epithelial and mesenchymal cell migration. By profiling a selected optimal set of 32 kinase inhibitors in a panel against six cell lines, we identified cell type-specific kinases that regulate cell migration. Our discovery of several informative kinases with a previously uncharacterized role in cell migration (such as Mst and Taok family of MAPK kinases in mesenchymal cells) may represent novel targets that warrant further investigation. Target deconvolution using …"
268,What controls the cell cycle,1991,Andrew W Murray and Marc W Kirschner,"By 1900 scientists had already identified the basic events of the cell cycle-the growth and divi sion of a single cell into daughter cells. Yet until recently, little was known about what regulated that cycle, which in humans is vital not only to repro duction but also to growth, tissue re pair, immunity and countless other processes.In the past five years, two separate experimental approaches to the prob lem have converged on an astonishing finding. The regulation of the cycle in eukaryotes (all living organisms except bacteria and viruses) seems to depend to a great extent on changes in the ac tivity of a single molecule, called the cdc2 protein."
269,Resonant microchannel volume and mass measurements show that suspended cells swell during mitosis,2015,Sungmin Son and Joon Ho Kang and Seungeun Oh and Marc W Kirschner and TJ Mitchison and Scott Manalis,"Osmotic regulation of intracellular water during mitosis is poorly understood because methods for monitoring relevant cellular physical properties with sufficient precision have been limited. Here we use a suspended microchannel resonator to monitor the volume and density of single cells in suspension with a precision of 1% and 0.03%, respectively. We find that for transformed murine lymphocytic leukemia and mouse pro–B cell lymphoid cell lines, mitotic cells reversibly increase their volume by more than 10% and decrease their density by 0.4% over a 20-min period. This response is correlated with the mitotic cell cycle but is not coupled to nuclear osmolytes released by nuclear envelope breakdown, chromatin condensation, or cytokinesis and does not result from endocytosis of the surrounding fluid. Inhibiting Na-H exchange eliminates the response. Although mitotic rounding of adherent cells is necessary for …"
270,The fate of cells in the tailbud of Xenopus laevis,2000,Robert L Davis and Marc W Kirschner,"The vertebrate tailbud and trunk form very similar tissues. It has been a controversial question for decades whether cell determination in the developing tail proceeds as part of early axial development or whether it proceeds by a different mechanism. To examine this question more closely, we have used photoactivation of fluorescence to mark small neighborhoods of cells in the developing tailbud of Xenopus laevis. We show that, in one region of the tailbud, very small groups of adjacent cells can contribute progeny to the neural tube, notochord and somitic muscle, as well as other identified cell types within a single embryo. Groups averaging three adjacent cells at a later stage can contribute progeny with a similar distribution. Our data suggest that the tailbud contains multipotent cells that make very late germ-layer decisions."
272,Need-based up-regulation of protein levels in response to deletion of their duplicate genes,2010,Alexander DeLuna and Michael Springer and Marc W Kirschner and Roy Kishony,Duplicated genes compensate for loss of one of the paralogs by up-regulating the remaining paralog only under growth conditions in which paralog activity is required for survival.
273,Xbra functions as a switch between cell migration and convergent extension in the Xenopus gastrula,2003,Kristen M Kwan and Marc W Kirschner,"During Xenopus gastrulation, the dorsal mesoderm exhibits two  different cell behaviors in two different regions: active cell migration of  prechordal mesoderm and convergent extension of chordamesoderm. Although many  genes involved in specification and differentiation of the dorsal mesoderm  have been studied, the role of these genes in controlling cell behaviors is  poorly understood. To understand better the link between the development and  cell behaviors of the dorsal mesoderm, we have examined these behaviors in  dissociated cells and explants, where activin protein can induce both active  cell migration and convergent extension. We find that Xbra, a  transcription factor necessary for convergent extension, actively inhibits  cell migration, both in animal cap explant assays and in the endogenous dorsal  mesoderm. In addition, Xbra appears to inhibit cell migration by  inhibiting adhesion to fibronectin …"
274,Molecular targets of vertebrate segmentation: two mechanisms control segmental expression of Xenopus hairy2 during somite formation,2001,Robert L Davis and David L Turner and Louise M Evans and Marc W Kirschner,"Vertebrate hairy genes are expressed in patterns thought to be readouts of a “segmentation clock” in the presomitic mesoderm. Here we use transgenic Xenopus embryos to show that two types of regulatory elements are required to reconstitute the segmental pattern of Xenopus hairy2. The first is a promoter element containing two binding sites for Xenopus Su(H), a transcriptional activator of Notch target genes. The second is a short sequence in the hairy2 3′ untranslated region (UTR), which most likely functions posttranscriptionally to modulate hairy2 RNA levels. 3′ UTRs of other hairy-related, segmentally expressed genes can substitute for that of hairy2. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism regulating the segmental patterns of Notch target genes and suggest that vertebrate segmentation requires the intersection of two regulatory pathways."
275,[5] Aspartate transcarbamoylase (Escherichia coli): Preparation of subunits,1978,Ying R Yang and Marc W Kirschner and HK Schachman,"This chapter provides information on the purification method of aspartate transcarbamoylase. The method described is slightly modified from Kirschner's method and provides high yields of purified catalytic and regulatory subunits. The procedure presented is analogous to that of Gerhart and Holoubek except that neohydrin is used in place of p-mercuribenzoate for the dissociation of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) and diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose is used for the chromatographic separation of the subunits instead of DEAE-Sephadex. Aspartate transcarbamoylase catalyzes the first reaction unique to pyrimidine biosynthesis; in E. coli regulation is achieved in part by feedback inhibition of the enzyme by cytidine triphosphate (CTP), an end-product of the pathway. The purified enzyme when treated with the mercurial, pmercuribenzoate is known to dissociate into two types of subunits …"
276,Multiple alpha and beta tubulin genes represent unlinked and dispersed gene families.,1981,DW Cleveland and SH Hughes and E Stubblefield and MW Kirschner and HE Varmus,"Cloned cDNA sequences specific for alpha or beta tubulin mRNAs have been used to show that the multigene families which encode either alpha or beta tubulin are unlinked and dispersed throughout the chicken genome. Fractions of chicken chromosomes partially purified by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient were digested with restriction endonucleases and electrophoresed on agarose gels. The DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized to labeled probes constructed from cloned cDNA sequences specific for alpha or beta tubulin. We find alpha tubulin sequences on four different chicken chromosomes and beta tubulin sequences on at least two different chromosomes. Moreover, using chicken chromosomes further purified with a fluorescent cell sorter, we have been able unambiguously to localize alpha tubulin genes to chromosome 1 and chromosome 8 and two of the beta genes to …"
277,Conformational changes in proteins as measured by difference sedimentation studies. I. Technique for measuring small changes in sedimentation coefficient,1971,Marc W Kirschner and HK Schachman,"Marc W. Kirschnerf and H. K. Schachman abstract: Increased interest in thedetection and measure-ment of the conformational changes in macromolecules produced by specific ligands has prompted a reinvestigation of the applicability of hydrodynamic methods and, in particular, of a technique for the direct measurement of small differences in sedimentation coefficient. Difference sedimenta-tion based on Rayleigh interference optics, as described by Richards and Schachman is a subtractive technique for measuring small differences in sedimentation coefficient directly.This method was shown to be capable of great precision but at the time of its introduction it suffered from systematic errors. These inaccuracies have been found now to be due to deficiencies in ultracentrifuge cells, misalignment of the Rayleigh mask, and an optical anomaly produced by high concentration gradients. Suitable remedieshave been …"
278,The master cell cycle regulator APC-Cdc20 regulates ciliary length and disassembly of the primary cilium,2014,Weiping Wang and Tao Wu and Marc W Kirschner,"The primary cilium has an important role in signaling; defects in structure are associated with a variety of human diseases. Much of the most basic biology of this organelle is poorly understood, even basic mechanisms, such as control of growth and resorption. We show that the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an E3 that regulates the onset of anaphase, destabilizes axonemal microtubules in the primary cilium. Furthermore, the metaphase APC co-activator, Cdc20, is specifically recruited to the basal body of primary cilia. Inhibition of APC-Cdc20 activity increases the ciliary length, while overexpression of Cdc20 suppresses cilium formation. APC-Cdc20 activity is required for the timely resorption of the cilium after serum stimulation. In addition, APC regulates the stability of axonemal microtubules through targeting Nek1, the ciliary kinase, for proteolysis. These data demonstrate a novel function of APC beyond cell cycle control and implicate critical role of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in ciliary disassembly.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03083.001"
279,SCF-mediated Cdh1 degradation defines a negative feedback system that coordinates cell-cycle progression,2013,Hidefumi Fukushima and Kohei Ogura and Lixin Wan and Ying Lu and Victor Li and Daming Gao and Pengda Liu and Alan W Lau and Tao Wu and Marc W Kirschner and Hiroyuki Inuzuka and Wenyi Wei,"Proper cell-cycle transitions are driven by waves of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of key regulators by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. But precisely how APC and SCF activities are coordinated to regulate cell-cycle progression remains largely unclear. We previously showed that APC/Cdh1 earmarks the SCF component Skp2 for degradation. Here, we continue to report that SCFβ-TRCP reciprocally controls APC/Cdh1 activity by governing Cdh1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Furthermore, we define both cyclin A and Plk1, two well-known Cdh1 substrates, as upstream modifying enzymes that promote Cdh1 phosphorylation to trigger Cdh1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by SCFβ-TRCP. Thus, our work reveals a negative repression mechanism for SCF to control APC, thereby illustrating an elegant dual repression …"
280,Biochemical suppression of small-molecule inhibitors: a strategy to identify inhibitor targets and signaling pathway components,2006,Jeffrey R Peterson and Andres M Lebensohn and Henry E Pelish and Marc W Kirschner,"Identification of small-molecule targets remains an important challenge for chemical genetics. We report an approach for target identification and protein discovery based on functional suppression of chemical inhibition in vitro. We discovered pirl1, an inhibitor of actin assembly, in a screen conducted with cytoplasmic extracts. Pirl1 was used to partially inhibit actin assembly in the same assay, and concentrated biochemical fractions of cytoplasmic extracts were added to find activities that suppressed pirl1 inhibition. Two activities were detected, separately purified, and identified as Arp2/3 complex and Cdc42/RhoGDI complex, both known regulators of actin assembly. We show that pirl1 directly inhibits activation of Cdc42/RhoGDI, but that Arp2/3 complex represents a downstream suppressor. This work introduces a general method for using low-micromolar chemical inhibitors to identify both inhibitor targets and …"

282,Some thoughts on the partitioning of tubulin between monomer and polymer under conditions of dynamic instability,1987,TJ Mitchison and MW Kirschner,"We have considered the partitioning of tubulin between monomer and polymer in the cell under conditions of dynamic instability. Dynamic instability adds to the on and off rate constant of steady-state dynamics’ new parameters: (1) the rate at which growing microtubules transit to a shrinking phase; and (2) the rate at which shrinking microtubules transit to the growing phase. Under these conditions the free-monomer concentration in the cell increases with total tubulin if the number of nucleating sites is fixed. If the number of nucleating sites increases at fixed total tubulin, subunits shift from the monomer to the polymer phase. These important properties deviate from the traditional equilibrium and steady-state theories and have important implications for the biosynthetic regulation of tubulin."
283,Molecular ties between the cell cycle and differentiation in embryonic stem cells,2014,Victor C Li and Marc W Kirschner,"Attainment of the differentiated state during the final stages of somatic cell differentiation is closely tied to cell cycle progression. Much less is known about the role of the cell cycle at very early stages of embryonic development. Here, we show that molecular pathways involving the cell cycle can be engineered to strongly affect embryonic stem cell differentiation at early stages in vitro. Strategies based on perturbing these pathways can shorten the rate and simplify the lineage path of ES differentiation. These results make it likely that pathways involving cell proliferation intersect at various points with pathways that regulate cell lineages in embryos and demonstrate that this knowledge can be used profitably to guide the path and effectiveness of cell differentiation of pluripotent cells."
284,Cdh1 regulates cell cycle through modulating the claspin/Chk1 and the Rb/E2F1 pathways,2009,Daming Gao and Hiroyuki Inuzuka and Michael Korenjak and Alan Tseng and Tao Wu and Lixin Wan and Marc Kirschner and Nicholas Dyson and Wenyi Wei,"APC/Cdh1 is a major cell cycle regulator and its function has been implicated in DNA damage repair; however, its exact role remains unclear. Using affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified Claspin as a novel Cdh1-interacting protein and further demonstrated that Claspin is a novel Cdh1 ubiquitin substrate. As a result, inactivation of Cdh1 leads to activation of the Claspin/Chk1 pathway. Previously, we demonstrated that Rb interacts with Cdh1 to influence its ability to degrade Skp2. Here, we report that Cdh1 reciprocally regulates the Rb pathway through competing with E2F1 to bind the hypophosphorylated form of Rb. Although inactivation of Cdh1 in HeLa cells, with defective p53/Rb pathways, led to premature S phase entry, acute depletion of Cdh1 in primary human fibroblasts resulted in premature senescence. Acute loss of many other major tumor suppressors, including PTEN and …"
285,Monoclonal antibodies specific for thiophosphorylated proteins recognize Xenopus MPF,1988,Martha S Cyert and Talma Scherson and Marc W Kirschner,"Maturation promoting factor, (MPF), is a crucial regulatory component of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Though it is ubiquitous, MPF has been difficult to purify to homogeneity, and little is known about its physical properties or composition. In an attempt to further characterize and purify this protein, we have isolated five monoclonal antibodies that immunoadsorb MPF activity, and inhibit the activity in solution. However, all the antibodies recognize many proteins in partially purified MPF. We have shown that antibody binding is dependent on previous exposure of the preparation to ATPγS. This suggests that the antibodies specifically recognize thiophosphoproteins, although not all thiophosphorylated proteins in MPF are immunoprecipitated. Using one antibody, MPF was partially purified by immunoadsorption chromatography. These experiments provide the first evidence that MPF from Xenopus is a phosphoprotein that …"
287,Conformational changes in proteins as measured by difference sedimentation studies. II. Effect of stereospecific ligands on the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase,1971,Marc W Kirschner and HK Schachman,"Marc W. Kirschnerf and H. K. Schachman abstract: The technique of difference sedimentation has been employed to measure small changes in the sedimentation coefficient of the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) in the presence of specific ligands. Succinate or carbamyl phosphate alone produced smallincreases in the sedimentation coefficient of the catalytic subunit which stemmed principally from theadded weight and density of the bound ligands. Both ligands together at concentrations of 2 mM, however, produced an increase in s of 1.05%, which is three times larger than the expected increase due merely to binding the ligands. Differential sedimentation experiments using a synthetic boundary cell showed that the concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficient was nearly the same in the presence or absence of ligands. This result Indicated that theincrease in sedimentation …"
288,Anaphase specific auto‐cleavage of separase,2002,Hui Zou and Olaf Stemman and Jens S Anderson and Matthias Mann and Marc W Kirschner,"Sister‐chromatid separation is triggered by a specific proteolytic cleavage of chromosomal cohesins catalyzed by the endopeptidase separase. Prior to anaphase, separase is inhibited independently by affinity binding to securin and by specific inhibitory phosphorylation. Here we show that separase itself is also subjected to proteolytic cleavages at three adjacent sites. The cleavages are auto‐catalyzed and occur specifically at anaphase coincident with separase activation. The cleaved fragments remain associated with each other and are catalytically active. Mapping of the cleavage sites reveals that all three sites are conserved in vertebrates underlining a significant function for this regulation."
289,Cyclin B and E2F-1 expression in prostate carcinoma cells treated with the novel retinoid CD437 are regulated by the ubiquitin-mediated pathway,2002,Lulu Farhana and Marcia Dawson and Arun K Rishi and Yuxiang Zhang and Eric Van Buren and Charu Trivedi and Uwe Reichert and Guowei Fang and Marc W Kirschner and Joseph A Fontana,"E2F-1 and cyclin B are important regulators of the cell cycle, and their expressionand degradation are tightly regulated. Proteolysis of both molecules is mediated by the ubiquitin degradation pathway involving the activation of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. Treatment of prostate carcinoma cells with the novel retinoid 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid (CD437/AHPN) results in the enhanced expression of E2F-1 and rapid degradation of cyclin B in the absence of the modulation of mRNA levels; this is accompanied by the S phase arrest of the cells and subsequent apoptosis. The elevated level of E2F-1 is because of the enhanced stability of the molecule, as indicated by pulse-labeling studies, demonstrating a prolonged half-life. The enhanced E2F-1 stability is associated with the concomitant acetylation of E2F-1, the disassociation of E2F-1 from the E2F-1 E3 ligase p45SKP2, and …"

This qQq-FTICR mass spectrometer was designed for the study of post-translationally modified proteins and for top-down analysis of biologically relevant protein samples. The utility of the instrument for the analysis of phosphorylation, a common and important post-translational modification, was investigated. Phosphorylation was chosen as an example because it is ubiquitous and challenging to analyze. In addition, the use of the instrument for top-down sequencing of proteins was explored since this instrument offers particular advantages to this approach. Top-down sequencing was performed on different proteins, including commercially available proteins and biologically derived samples such as the human E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UbCH10. A …"
292,The polarity and stability of microtubule capture by the kinetochore.,1988,P Huitorel and MW Kirschner,"We have studied the capture of microtubules by isolated metaphase chromosomes, using microtubules stabilized with taxol and marked with biotin tubulin to distinguish their plus and minus ends. The capture reaction is reversible at both the plus and minus ends. The on rate of capture is the same for both polarities but the dissociation rate from the kinetochore is seven times slower with microtubules captured at their plus ends than those captured at their minus ends. At steady state this disparity in off rates leads to the gradual replacement of microtubules captured at their minus ends with those captured at their plus ends. These results suggest that the kinetochore makes a lateral attachment near the end of the microtubule in the initial capture reaction and shows a structural specificity that may be important in proper bipolar attachment of the chromosome to the spindle."

Using this technique, we have isolated two proteins that are structurally similar to Mix.1, a PAX class homeodomain protein with ventralizing activity in Xenopus. The Mix family of proteins are expressed during late blastula and gastrula stages of Xenopus development. During gastrulation, these genes are expressed at high levels in distinct, yet overlapping regions in mesoderm and endoderm. The members of the Mix family heterodimerize with each other and overexpression of each results in severe axial abnormalities. Mix.3 and Mix.4 can directly induce primitive ectoderm to become endoderm whereas Mix.1 cannot. Injection of Mix.3 or Mix.4 RNA in the whole embryo results in extensive ectopic endodermin mRNA expression. The expression of the Mix family …"
295,The surface contraction waves of Xenopus eggs reflect the metachronous cell-cycle state of the cytoplasm,1997,Susannah Rankin and Marc W Kirschner,"Activated Xenopus laevis eggs undergo a series of surface contractions in response to cell-cycle progression but fall to cleave unless the sperm centrosome is present. These surface contraction waves (SCWs) begin at the animal pole and progress around the egg, occur every cell cycle and precede cleavage [1], [2], [3]. The SCWs are biphasic, comprising a relaxation phase (SCWa) and a contraction phase (SCWb). To investigate how these events are linked to the underlying cell cycle, we studied the temporal and spatial relationship between the SCWs and previously characterized biochemical markers of cell-cycle progression. We found that the relaxation phase was a response to activated maturation-promoting factor (MPF). In contrast, the contraction phase required inactivation of MPF and was blocked when MPF activity was maintained at elevated levels. We also found that a wave of MPF activity traveled …"

297,Timing of events in mitosis,2002,Ann B Georgi and P Todd Stukenberg and Marc W Kirschner,"Background: Regulation of the major transitions in the cell cycle, such as G1/S, G2/M, and metaphase to anaphase, are increasingly well understood. However, we have a poor understanding of the timing of events within each phase of the cell cycle, such as S phase or early mitosis. Two extreme models of regulation are possible. A “regulator-controlled model” in which the order of events is governed by the activation of a series of cytoplasmic regulators, such as kinases, phosphatases, or proteases; or a “substrate-controlled model” in which temporal regulation is determined by the differential responses of the cellular machinery to a common set of activators.Results: We have tried to distinguish between these two models by examining the timing of both biochemical and morphological events in Xenopus egg extracts during mitosis. Several proteins respond with different delays to the activation of Cdc2. We have …"
298,The role of biomedical research in health care reform,1994,Marc W Kirschner and Elizabeth Marincola and Elizabeth Olmsted Teisberg,"The national debate about health care re-form presumes a simple trade-off among quality, cost, and access. Most Americans, who are already insured, instinctively fear that expanding access, although desirable, will inevitably lead to higher costs or re-duced quality for everyone. This quandary is inevitable only if the focus is on cutting the costs of delivering today's health care, rath-er than on improving the quality and bring-ing down its costs for tomorrow. The critical issue that reformers are ignoring is innovation. In spite of the powerful potential of innovation to reduce health care costs, skewed incentives in the current system have caused some innovations to be used in cost-increasing ways, leading many observers to believe mistakenly that medical in-novation necessarily increases costs. But this is a dangerous mistake in logic. Successful reform must encourage innovation and create strong incentives for …"
299,Phosphoinositides and membrane curvature switch the mode of actin polymerization via selective recruitment of toca-1 and Snx9,2013,Jennifer L Gallop and Astrid Walrant and Lewis C Cantley and Marc W Kirschner,"The membrane–cytosol interface is the major locus of control of actin polymerization. At this interface, phosphoinositides act as second messengers to recruit membrane-binding proteins. We show that curved membranes, but not flat ones, can use phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] along with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] to stimulate actin polymerization. In this case, actin polymerization requires the small GTPase cell cycle division 42 (Cdc42), the nucleation-promoting factor neural Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the actin nucleator the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex. In liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2 as the sole phosphoinositide, actin polymerization requires transducer of Cdc42 activation-1 (toca-1). In the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, polymerization is both more efficient and independent of toca-1. Under these conditions, sorting nexin 9 …"
300,Emi1 preferentially inhibits ubiquitin chain elongation by the anaphase-promoting complex,2013,Weiping Wang and Marc W Kirschner,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is the crucial ubiquitin ligase targeting the regulatory machinery of the cell cycle. Emi1, a major modulator of APC activity, is thought to act competitively as a pseudosubstrate. We show that the modulation of APC activity is more subtle: Emi1 inhibits ubiquitylation at both substrate binding and separately at the step of ubiquitin transfer to APC-bound substrates. The zinc-binding region of Emi1 allows multiple monoubiquitylation of substrates, but preferentially suppresses the ubiquitin chain elongation by UBCH10. Furthermore, the carboxy-terminal tail of Emi1 antagonizes chain elongation by Ube2S, by competitively preventing its binding to the APC cullin subunit through electrostatic interaction. Combinatorially, Emi1 effectively stabilizes APC substrates by suppressing ubiquitin chain extension. Deubiquitylating enzymes can then convert inhibited substrates to their basal …"
301,The mechanism and pattern of yolk consumption provide insight into embryonic nutrition in Xenopus,2009,Paul Jorgensen and Judith AJ Steen and Hanno Steen and Marc W Kirschner,"Little is known about how metabolism changes during development. For most animal embryos, yolk protein is a principal source of nutrition, particularly of essential amino acids. Within eggs, yolk is stored inside large organelles called yolk platelets (YPs). We have gained insight into embryonic nutrition in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis by studying YPs. Amphibians follow the ancestral pattern in which all embryonic cells inherit YPs from the egg cytoplasm. These YPs are consumed intracellularly at some point during embryogenesis, but it was not known when, where or how yolk consumption occurs. We have identified the novel yolk protein Seryp by biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses of purified YPs. Within individual YPs, Seryp is degraded to completion earlier than the major yolk proteins, thereby providing a molecular marker for YPs engaged in yolk proteolysis. We demonstrate that yolk …"

Here we present a density map at a resolution of 25 Å of negatively stained separase–securin complex. Based on labeling data and sequence analysis, we propose a model for the structure of separase, consisting of 26 ARM repeats, an unstructured region of 280 residues and two caspase-like domains, with securin binding to the ARM repeats."
303,Graded positional information: interpretation for both fate and guidance,2003,Miriam Osterfield and Marc W Kirschner and John G Flanagan,"Recent evidence indicates that gradients of the same extracellular molecules can act as both morphogens, specifying cell differentiation, and guidance cues, directing axon movement. We discuss how cells may use common mechanisms to convert graded information into discrete responses; and how extracellular signals provide coordinate systems that can be linked to highly diverse cellular outputs."
304,Remodeling of the metabolome during early frog development,2011,Livia Vastag and Paul Jorgensen and Leonid Peshkin and Ru Wei and Joshua D Rabinowitz and Marc W Kirschner,"A rapid series of synchronous cell divisions initiates embryogenesis in many animal species, including the frog Xenopus laevis. After many of these cleavage cycles, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio increases sufficiently to somehow cause cell cycles to elongate and become asynchronous at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). We have discovered that an unanticipated remodeling of core metabolic pathways occurs during the cleavage cycles and the MBT in X.laevis, as evidenced by widespread changes in metabolite abundance. While many of the changes in metabolite abundance were consistently observed, it was also evident that different female frogs laid eggs with different levels of at least some metabolites. Metabolite tracing with heavy isotopes demonstrated that alanine is consumed to generate energy for the early embryo. dATP pools were found to decline during the MBT and we have confirmed that maternal pools of dNTPs are functionally exhausted at the onset of the MBT. Our results support an alternative hypothesis that the cell cycle lengthening at the MBT is triggered not by a limiting maternal protein, as is usually proposed, but by a decline in dNTP pools brought about by the exponentially increasing demands of DNA synthesis."
305,Specificity of the anaphase-promoting complex: a single-molecule study,2015,Ying Lu and Weiping Wang and Marc W Kirschner,"Regulation of biological processes is generally thought to be conveyed by structurally complementary interactions between molecules, resulting in a bound state that is the most energetically stable. However, the limited size of most recognition motifs poses a very general question as to how specificity is actually achieved. In the cell cycle, timing of events from exit of mitosis through passage into G1 is regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an enzyme that catalyzes ubiquitin conjugation to multiple lysines on substrate molecules, for proteasome-mediated degradation. The difference in how APC ubiquitylates its substrates leads to the ordering of events. APC-substrate interactions are also mediated through very short and redundant sequences, such as the well-studied D and KEN boxes found in 69% of human proteins. It is unclear how the APC can distinguish a relatively small …"
306,Morphogenesis and the control of microtubule dynamics in cells,1986,MARC KIRSCHNER and ERIC SCHULZE,"Microtubules show unusual dynamic properties at steady state in vitro. While overall the polymer mass remains stable, individual polymers in the population are either growing or shrinking. This phenomenon called dynamic instability is best explained by the known coupling of polymerization to GTP hydrolysis, and the hypothesis that the stability or instability of the whole polymer is determined by whether GTP or GDP is bound to the terminal subunit. Similar unusual dynamics have now also been found in vivo. By visualizing new subunit assembly after injection of tubulin modified with biotin into living fibroblast cells, we can visualize new growth on individual microtubules with antibody to biotin. Microtubules grow in vivo at about 4 μm min−1 and after rapid and precessive depolymerization old microtubules are replaced by new growth from the centrosome. Some microtubules turn over much more slowly and these stable microtubules have a different spatial distribution from the majority of dynamic ones. The existence of both stable and dynamic microtubules in the same cell suggests a model for morphogenesis of the microtubule cytoskeleton. The rapid turnover of microtubules in the cell provides a complex population upon which selective factors can act. Stability can be generated at the end of the polymer and affects the entire microtubule. This model of selective stabilization at the microtubule ends is discussed in terms of recent experiments on the establishment of kinetochore-pole microtubules during mitosis."
307,Induced formation of asters and cleavage furrows in oocytes of Xenopus laevis during in vitro maturation,1978,Steven R Heidemann and Marc W Kirschner,"We have previously reported that injection of purified basal bodies or sperm into unfertilized eggs of Xenopus laevis induced the formation of asters and irregular cleavage furrows. Fully grown oocytes were found to be unable to form asters or cleavage furrows. In this paper we show that the oocyte acquires the ability to form asters upon basal body injection at the time of germinal vesicle breakdown during in vitro maturation. Our evidence indicates that aster formation requires progesterone‐stimulated changes in the oocyte and mixing of cytoplasm and germinal vesicle plasm. The ability of the oocyte to form cleavage furrows arises six to eight hours after germinal vesicle breakdown. We infer that some maturational change in the cell cortex occurs to enable the egg surface to furrow. Experiments on the relationship of aster formation to furrow initiation indicates that asters stimulate furrow formation. However, some …"

309,Identification of multiple CDH1 homologues in vertebrates conferring different substrate specificities,2001,Yong Wan and Marc W Kirschner,"CDC20/CDH1 activates the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and targets various substrates for degradation, thereby allowing the ordered progression through mitosis and G1. We have found multiple functional CDH1 homologues in the chick. The transcripts of these novel genes are differentially localized to proliferating, differentiated, and postmitotic tissues. All four proteins bind and form a complex with APC in vitro and in cultural cells and have quantitatively different activities in mediating ubiquitination of various APC substrates. Our results suggest that multiple CDH1s may temporally and spatially regulate APC activity both within and outside of the cell cycle."

As a follow up, we convened a two-day workshop in August that brought together 30 relatively senior individuals engaged in various aspects of biomedical science, including social scientists and others who are knowledgeable about the training pipeline.Attendees were asked to assess two central issues: the validity of the case that we made in our article (1) and the prospects for convening a much larger and more inclusive meeting to produce a concerted plan for remedial actions. There was near unanimity among the attendees that the system is under tremendous strain, which threatens the vitality of"
311,"Hemichordate embryos: procurement, culture, and basic methods",2004,Christopher J Lowe and Kuni Tagawa and Tom Humphreys and Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart,"This chapter focuses on practical considerations for the collection of hemichordate adults and procurement of gametes for carrying out developmental studies. The chapter describes methods for collecting, spawning, and rearing embryos and larvae from two species of hemichordate—Saccoglossus kowalevskii (S. kowalevskii) and Ptychodera flava, the latter an indirect developer producing a true larval form and the former a direct-developing species. S. kowalevskii is found along the eastern seaboard of the United States from South Carolina to New Hampshire. It is an intertidal species found mainly in sheltered bays and forms its burrows in coarse organic sand, often in clam beds. The worms are approximately 6 to 9 inches long and form U-shaped burrows. Ptychodera flava is found along the extensive range throughout the Indo-Pacific. The worms are approximately 10 to 25 cm long and 1 to 2 …"
312,Molecular cloning of tyrosine kinases in the early Xenopus embryo: Identification of eck‐related genes expressed in cranial neural crest cells of the second (Hyoid …,1995,AW Brändli and MW Kirschner,"Growth factors and their receptors play an important role in controlling cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation during vertebrate embryogenesis. We have used the reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction to survey the repertoire of receptor tyrosine kinases (TK) expressed during early embryogenesis of Xenopus laevis. Twelve distinct Xenopus TK cDNA classes were identified among a total of 352 cDNAs screened. A single TK cDNA class has been described previously and encodes the fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR‐A1. The remaining 11 TK cDNA classes appear to encode novel genes of the FGFR, platelet‐derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), Eph, Csk, Tyk2, and Klg subfamilies. By RNase protection assays, Xenopus TK mRNAs are rare transcripts (≤107 mRNA mol‐ecules/embryo), and are usually found to be expressed also maternally in the embryo. Most Xenopus TK genes …"
313,M-phase promoting factors from eggs of Xenopus laevis.,1985,J Gerhart and M Wu and M Cyert and M Kirschner,"When an M-phase promoting factor (MPF) is injected into Xenopus oocytes, which are naturally arrested at the G2/prophase boundary, it induces rapid entry of the cells into M-phase. MPF is present in late G2 and in M-phase of a variety of cell types, such as Xenopus eggs (naturally arrested in M), cleaving embryos, yeast, HeLa, and CHO cultures. MPF has been purified approximately 50-fold from eggs. It is stabilized by gamma-thio-ATP and by phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitors. It runs as a protein of approximately 100 kd size on gel filtration. Oocytes contain a precursor of MPF, which is activated by post-translational means when a small amount of purified MPF is injected into the cell. Thus, MPF appears to be an auto-activating cytoplasmic trigger of M-phase. At anaphase of the cell cycle, MPF is inactivated due to the appearance of an'anti-MPF'activity. Monoclonal antibodies have been prepared to partially purified MPF stabilized by gamma-thio-ATP, and several preparations which inactivate MPF were obtained. The antibodies are directed against thio-phosphate groups carried by a set of proteins including MPF. This indicates that MPF is present in our active preparations as a thio-phosphoprotein. These and other data suggest that MPF is normally activated in the cell cycle by a phosphorylation reaction."
314,Preparation of 125I-catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase and its use in studies of the regulatory subunit,1973,J Michael Syvanen and Ying R Yang and Marc W Kirschner,"A quantitative specific assay for the regulatory subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase is described. The assay, in which the native enzyme will not interfere even when present in large excess, is sensitive to 5 ng of regulatory subunit at a concentration as low as 0.1 µg per mg in crude extracts. The assay utilizes a 125I-labeled catalytic subunit which combines spontaneously with regulatory subunit to form a complex which co-migrates with the native enzyme on acrylamide gel electrophoresis in a position clearly separable from the 125I-catalytic subunit. The amount of regulatory subunit can then be calculated from the known weight ratio in the enzyme complex. Mutants of Salmonella typhimurium defective in aspartate transcarbamylase activity are shown to still synthesize regulatory subunit, while a mutant constitutive for the enzymes in the pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis is shown to produce an excess of free …"
315,Cell size sensing in animal cells coordinates anabolic growth rates and cell cycle progression to maintain cell size uniformity,2018,Miriam Bracha Ginzberg and Nancy Chang and Heather D'Souza and Nish Patel and Ran Kafri and Marc W Kirschner,"Cell size uniformity in healthy tissues suggests that control mechanisms might coordinate cell growth and division. We derived a method to assay whether cellular growth rates depend on cell size, by monitoring how variance in size changes as cells grow. Our data revealed that, twice during the cell cycle, growth rates are selectively increased in small cells and reduced in large cells, ensuring cell size uniformity. This regulation was also observed directly by monitoring nuclear growth in live cells. We also detected cell-size-dependent adjustments of G1 length, which further reduce variability. Combining our assays with chemical/genetic perturbations confirmed that cells employ two strategies, adjusting both cell cycle length and growth rate, to maintain the appropriate size. Additionally, although Rb signaling is not required for these regulatory behaviors, perturbing Cdk4 activity still influences cell size, suggesting that the Cdk4 pathway may play a role in designating the cell’s target size."
316,Proteomics of phosphorylation and protein dynamics during fertilization and meiotic exit in the Xenopus egg,2017,Marc Presler and Elizabeth Van Itallie and Allon M Klein and Ryan Kunz and Margaret L Coughlin and Leonid Peshkin and Steven P Gygi and Martin Wühr and Marc W Kirschner,"Fertilization releases the meiotic arrest and initiates the events that prepare the egg for the ensuing developmental program. Protein degradation and phosphorylation are known to regulate protein activity during this process. However, the full extent of protein loss and phosphoregulation is still unknown. We examined absolute protein and phosphosite dynamics of the fertilization response by mass spectrometry-based proteomics in electroactivated eggs. To do this, we developed an approach for calculating the stoichiometry of phosphosites from multiplexed proteomics that is compatible with dynamic, stable, and multisite phosphorylation. Overall, the data suggest that degradation is limited to a few low-abundance proteins. However, this degradation promotes extensive dephosphorylation that occurs over a wide range of abundances during meiotic exit. We also show that eggs release a large amount of protein into …"
317,An inhibitor of p34cdc2/cyclin B that regulates the G2/M transition in Xenopus extracts,1996,Tina H Lee and Marc W Kirschner,"The activity of maturation-promoting factor (MPF), a protein kinase complex composed of p34cdc2 and cyclin B, is undetectable during interphase but rises abruptly at the G2/M transition to induce mitosis. After the synthesis of cyclin B, the suppression of MPF activity before mitosis has been attributed to the phosphorylation of p34cdc2 on sites (threonine-14 and tyrosine-15) that inhibit its catalytic activity. We previously showed that the activity of the mitotic p34cdc2/cyclin B complex is rapidly suppressed when added to interphase Xenopus extracts that lack endogenous cyclin B. Here we show that a mutant of p34cdc2 that cannot be inhibited by phosphorylation (threonine-14-->alanine, tyrosine-15-->phenylalanine) is also susceptible to inactivation, demonstrating that inhibitory mechanisms independent of threonine-14 and tyrosine-15 phosphorylation must exist. We have partially characterized this inhibitory …"
318,Mouse embryonic stem cells can differentiate via multiple paths to the same state,2017,James Alexander Briggs and Victor C Li and Seungkyu Lee and Clifford J Woolf and Allon Klein and Marc W Kirschner,"In embryonic development, cells differentiate through stereotypical sequences of intermediate states to generate particular mature fates. By contrast, driving differentiation by ectopically expressing terminal transcription factors (direct programming) can generate similar fates by alternative routes. How differentiation in direct programming relates to embryonic differentiation is unclear. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare two motor neuron differentiation protocols: a standard protocol approximating the embryonic lineage, and a direct programming method. Both initially undergo similar early neural commitment. Later, the direct programming path diverges into a novel transitional state rather than following the expected embryonic spinal intermediates. The novel state in direct programming has specific and uncharacteristic gene expression. It forms a loop in gene expression space that converges separately onto the same final motor neuron state as the standard path. Despite their different developmental histories, motor neurons from both protocols structurally, functionally, and transcriptionally resemble motor neurons isolated from embryos."
319,Local and gross conformational changes in aspartate transcarbamylase,1973,Marc W Kirschner and HK Schachman,"Marc W. Kirschnert and H. K. Schachman* abstract: Aspartate transcarbamylase and the free catalytic subunits isolated from it are known to undergo different, gross conformational changes upon the addition of the same, specific ligands. However, there has been little direct evidence indicating how, and to what extent, the catalytic subunits within the intact enzyme change upon the addition of ligands. In an effort to study the ligand-promoted conformational changes of the subunits within aspartate transcarbamylase we have prepared an enzyme-like complex composed of native regulatory subunits and modified catalytic subunits con-taining nitrotyrosyl chromophoreswhose spectrum was sensi-tive to the local environment. This modified enzyme ex-hibited the homotropic and heterotropic effects characteristic of native aspartate transcarbamylase. The spectral changes in the complex on binding ligands were similar …"
320,VHL substrate transcription factor ZHX2 as an oncogenic driver in clear cell renal cell carcinoma,2018,Jing Zhang and Tao Wu and Jeremy Simon and Mamoru Takada and Ryoichi Saito and Cheng Fan and Xian-De Liu and Eric Jonasch and Ling Xie and Xian Chen and Xiaosai Yao and Bin Tean Teh and Patrick Tan and Xingnan Zheng and Mingjie Li and Cortney Lawrence and Jie Fan and Jiang Geng and Xijuan Liu and Lianxin Hu and Jun Wang and Chengheng Liao and Kai Hong and Giada Zurlo and Joel S Parker and J Todd Auman and Charles M Perou and W Kimryn Rathmell and William Y Kim and Marc W Kirschner and William G Kaelin and Albert S Baldwin and Qing Zhang,"Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase protein is a hallmark of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Identifying how pathways affected by VHL loss contribute to ccRCC remains challenging. We used a genome-wide in vitro expression strategy to identify proteins that bind VHL when hydroxylated. Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) was found as a VHL target, and its hydroxylation allowed VHL to regulate its protein stability. Tumor cells from ccRCC patients with VHL loss-of-function mutations usually had increased abundance and nuclear localization of ZHX2. Functionally, depletion of ZHX2 inhibited VHL-deficient ccRCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and microarray analysis showed that ZHX2 promoted nuclear factor κB activation. These studies reveal ZHX2 as a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC."

The 202,175 ESTs represent 163,633 arrayed clones carrying cDNAs prepared from embryonic libraries, and they assemble into 13,677 continuous sequences (contigs), leaving 10,896 singletons (excluding mitochondrial sequences). Of the contigs, 53% had significant matches when BLAST was used to query the NCBI databases (≤10−10), as did 51% of the singletons. Contigs most frequently matched sequences from amphioxus (29%), chordates (67%), and deuterostomes (87%). From the clone array, we isolated 400 full-length sequences for transcription factors and signaling proteins of use for evolutionary and developmental studies. The set includes sequences for fox, pax, tbx, hox, and other homeobox-containing factors, and …"

The workshop paid particular attention to  evidence of pathology in the brains of people with schizophrenia, and  to the possibility that this reflects an abnormality in brain  development that eventually leads to the appearance of symptoms. The  participants were impressed with the complexity of the problem, and  felt that multiple approaches would be required to understand this  disease. They recommended that a major focus should be on the search  for predisposing genes, but that there should be parallel research in  many other areas."
323,Identical genomic organization of two hemichordate hox clusters,2012,Robert Freeman and Tetsuro Ikuta and Michael Wu and Ryo Koyanagi and Takeshi Kawashima and Kunifumi Tagawa and Tom Humphreys and Guang-Chen Fang and Asao Fujiyama and Hidetoshi Saiga and Christopher Lowe and Kim Worley and Jerry Jenkins and Jeremy Schmutz and Marc Kirschner and Daniel Rokhsar and Nori Satoh and John Gerhart,"Genomic comparisons of chordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms can inform hypotheses for the evolution of these strikingly different phyla from the last common deuterostome ancestor [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Because hox genes play pivotal developmental roles in bilaterian animals [6, 7, 8], we analyzed the Hox complexes of two hemichordate genomes. We find that Saccoglossus kowalevskii and Ptychodera flava both possess 12-gene clusters, with mir10 between hox4 and hox5, in 550 kb and 452 kb intervals, respectively. Genes hox1–hox9/10 of the clusters are in the same genomic order and transcriptional orientation as their orthologs in chordates, with hox1 at the 3′ end of the cluster. At the 5′ end, each cluster contains three posterior genes specific to Ambulacraria (the hemichordate-echinoderm clade), two forming an inverted terminal pair. In contrast, the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus contains a …"
324,The relationship between evolutionary and physiological variation in hemoglobin,2007,Ron Milo and Jennifer H Hou and Michael Springer and Michael P Brenner and Marc W Kirschner,"Physiological and evolutionary adaptations operate at very different time scales. Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe there should be a strong relationship between the two, as together they modify the phenotype. Physiological adaptations change phenotype by altering certain microscopic parameters; evolutionary adaptation can either alter genetically these same parameters or others to achieve distinct or similar ends. Although qualitative discussions of this relationship abound, there has been very little quantitative analysis. Here, we use the hemoglobin molecule as a model system to quantify the relationship between physiological and evolutionary adaptations. We compare measurements of oxygen saturation curves of 25 mammals with those of human hemoglobin under a wide range of physiological conditions. We fit the data sets to the Monod–Wyman–Changeux model to extract microscopic …"
325,G1 cyclin-dependent activation of p34CDC28 (Cdc28p) in vitro,1995,Raymond J Deshaies and Marc Kirschner,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transient accumulation of G1 cyclin/p34CDC28 (Cdc28p) complexes induces cells to traverse the cell cycle Start checkpoint and commit to a round of cell division. To investigate posttranslational controls that modulate Cdc28p activity during the G1 phase, we have reconstituted cyclin-dependent activation of Cdc28p in a cyclin-depleted G1 extract. A glutathione S-transferase-G1 cyclin chimera (GST-Cln2p) efficiently binds to and activates Cdc28p as a histone H1 kinase. Activation of Cdc28p by GST-Cln2p requires ATP, crude yeast cytosol, and the conserved Thr-169 residue that serves in other organisms as a substrate for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent protein kinase-activating kinase. This assay may be useful for distinguishing genes that promote directly the posttranslational assembly of active Cln2p/Cdc28p kinase complexes from those that stimulate the accumulation of …"
327,"The Drosophila homolog of MCPH1, a human microcephaly gene, is required for genomic stability in the early embryo",2007,Jamie L Rickmyre and Shamik DasGupta and Danny Liang-Yee Ooi and Jessica Keel and Ethan Lee and Marc W Kirschner and Scott Waddell and Laura A Lee,"Mutation of human microcephalin (MCPH1) causes autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, a developmental disorder characterized by reduced brain size. We identified mcph1, the Drosophila homolog of MCPH1, in a genetic screen for regulators of S-M cycles in the early embryo. Embryos of null mcph1 female flies undergo mitotic arrest with barrel-shaped spindles lacking centrosomes. Mutation of Chk2 suppresses these defects, indicating that they occur secondary to a previously described Chk2-mediated response to mitotic entry with unreplicated or damaged DNA. mcph1 embryos exhibit genomic instability as evidenced by frequent chromatin bridging in anaphase. In contrast to studies of human MCPH1, the ATR/Chk1-mediated DNA checkpoint is intact in Drosophila mcph1 mutants. Components of this checkpoint, however, appear to cooperate with MCPH1 to regulate embryonic cell cycles in a manner …"
328,Quantitative Lys-ϵ-Gly-Gly (diGly) proteomics coupled with inducible RNAi reveals ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) by the E3 ligase HUWE1,2014,Joel W Thompson and Jane Nagel and Sjouke Hoving and Bertran Gerrits and Andreas Bauer and Jason R Thomas and Marc W Kirschner and Markus Schirle and Sarah J Luchansky,"Targeted degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) via the activities of E3 ubiquitin ligases regulates diverse cellular processes, and misregulation of these enzymes contributes to the pathogenesis of human diseases. One of the challenges facing the UPS field is to delineate the complete cohort of substrates for a particular E3 ligase. Advances in mass spectrometry and the development of antibodies recognizing the Lys-ϵ-Gly-Gly (diGly) remnant from ubiquitinated proteins following trypsinolysis have provided a tool to address this question. We implemented an inducible loss of function approach in combination with quantitative diGly proteomics to find novel substrates of HUWE1 (HECT, UBA, and WWE domain containing 1, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase), an E3 ligase implicated in cancer and intellectual disabilities. diGly proteomics results led to the identification of DNA damage …"
329,Size uniformity of animal cells is actively maintained by a p38 MAPK-dependent regulation of G1-length,2018,Shixuan Liu and Miriam Bracha Ginzberg and Nish Patel and Marc Hild and Bosco Leung and Zhengda Li and Yen-Chi Chen and Nancy Chang and Yuan Wang and Ceryl Tan and Shulamit Diena and William Trimble and Larry Wasserman and Jeremy L Jenkins and Marc W Kirschner and Ran Kafri,"Animal cells within a tissue typically display a striking regularity in their size. To date, the molecular mechanisms that control this uniformity are still unknown. We have previously shown that size uniformity in animal cells is promoted, in part, by size-dependent regulation of G1 length. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, we performed a large-scale small molecule screen and found that the p38 MAPK pathway is involved in coordinating cell size and cell cycle progression. Small cells display higher p38 activity and spend more time in G1 than larger cells. Inhibition of p38 MAPK leads to loss of the compensatory G1 length extension in small cells, resulting in faster proliferation, smaller cell size and increased size heterogeneity. We propose a model wherein the p38 pathway responds to changes in cell size and regulates G1 exit accordingly, to increase cell size uniformity."
330,On a possible evolutionary link of the stomochord of hemichordates to pharyngeal organs of chordates,2014,Noriyuki Satoh and Kunifumi Tagawa and Christopher J Lowe and Jr‐Kai Yu and Takeshi Kawashima and Hiroki Takahashi and Michio Ogasawara and Marc Kirschner and Kanako Hisata and Yi‐Hsien Su and John Gerhart,"As a group closely related to chordates, hemichordate acorn worms are in a key phylogenic position for addressing hypotheses of chordate origins. The stomochord of acorn worms is an anterior outgrowth of the pharynx endoderm into the proboscis. In 1886 Bateson proposed homology of this organ to the chordate notochord, crowning this animal group “hemichordates.” Although this proposal has been debated for over a century, the question still remains unresolved. Here we review recent progress related to this question. First, the developmental mode of the stomochord completely differs from that of the notochord. Second, comparison of expression profiles of genes including Brachyury, a key regulator of notochord formation in chordates, does not support the stomochord/notochord homology. Third, FoxE that is expressed in the stomochord‐forming region in acorn worm juveniles is expressed in the club …"

332,Regulated proteolysis of Xom mediates dorsoventral pattern formation during early Xenopus development,2002,Zhenglun Zhu and Marc Kirschner,"To identify a regulatory role for proteolysis during early Xenopus development, we developed a biochemical screen for proteins that are degraded in an embryonic stage-specific manner. We found that Xom, a homeobox transcriptional repressor of dorsal-specific genes, was degraded precipitously during early gastrulation. Xom degradation is regulated by phosphorylation at a GSK3-like consensus site and is most likely mediated by the SCF-β-TRCP complex. Expression of nondegradable Xom represses transcription of dorsal genes much more effectively than wild-type Xom and results in a more strongly ventralized phenotype. We propose that regulated Xom proteolysis plays an essential role in the establishment of the dorsoventral axis, by converting a gradient in BMP abundance into a sharp dorsoventral pattern."
333,Hippo pathway mediates resistance to cytotoxic drugs,2017,Taranjit S Gujral and Marc W Kirschner,"Chemotherapy is widely used for cancer treatment, but its effectiveness is limited by drug resistance. Here, we report a mechanism by which cell density activates the Hippo pathway, which in turn inactivates YAP, leading to changes in the regulation of genes that control the intracellular concentrations of gemcitabine and several other US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oncology drugs. Hippo inactivation sensitizes a diverse panel of cell lines and human tumors to gemcitabine in 3D spheroid, mouse xenografts, and patient-derived xenograft models. Nuclear YAP enhances gemcitabine effectiveness by down-regulating multidrug transporters as well by converting gemcitabine to a less active form, both leading to its increased intracellular availability. Cancer cell lines carrying genetic aberrations that impair the Hippo signaling pathway showed heightened sensitivity to gemcitabine. These findings …"

335,THE ROLE OF RINGS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF MICROTUBULES IN VITRO*,1975,Marc W Kirschner and Mary Suter and Murray Weingarten and Daniel Littman,"Our concepts of macromolecular assembly have been derived from the detailed study of relatively few systems, such as actin, tobacco mosaic virus, and phage T4. Many of these systems assemble for one purpose, such as virus infection, and may even include some irreversible steps such as proteolytic cleavage.'Microtubule protein assembly involves reversible formation of subcellular structures in specific locations and in specific orientations. It is possible that this system may involve different principles of self-assembly, better suited to the plasticity of the assembly forms with which they are involved. It may therefore be interesting to determine the detailed mechanism of microtubule assembly. By studying this process in vitro, we hope to understand not only how microtubules assemble, but also how the cell controls the number of microtubules assembled, where they are assembled, and in which orientation they are …"
336,Assay for identifying extracellular signaling proteins,1996,Kevin D Lustig and Marc W Kirschner,"The present invention concerns a novel paracrine signal ing assay in which a"" responsive'tissue is grafted onto an oocyte, or early stage embryo, which expresses exogenous proteins. Using the subject assay, it is possible to cause the oocyte to ectopically express secreted proteins, eg recom binant proteins, and then score for the effect of that protein on the grafted tissue, such as by detecting gene expression in the graft which is dependent on expression of the recom binant proteins by the oocyte. The subject assay will permit the identification of a variety of protein factors which are themselves active as inducing agents, or which act to antago nize an inducing agent, or which act to modify the response of the target tissue to an inducing agent. For instance, the subject assay can be employed to identify a vast number of protein factors which are regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation, or various other cell functions."
337,Conformational studies on the nitrated catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase,1973,Marc W Kirschner and HK Schachman,"Marc W. Kirsehner! and H. K. Schachman’* abstract: A variety of physical-chemical techniques such as difference sedimentation, difference spectroscopy, and optical rotatory dispersion have shown that the isolated catalytic sub-units of aspartate transcarbamylase undergo changes in con-formation upon the addition of specific ligands. However these methods were not sufficientlydiscriminating to provide definitive evidence for the existence of comparable (or different) ligand-promoted conformational changes in these subunits when they are incorporated within intact enzyme molecules. Hence efforts were directed toward attaching a specific, sensitive chromophore onto the catalytic polypeptide chains so that a selective spectral probewould be available for such investigations. Accordingly studies were conducted on the nitration of the isolated catalytic subunits With tetranitro-methane. Under conditions which …"

However, upstream pathways governing BRAF kinase activity and protein stability remain undefined. Here, we report that in primary cells with active APCFZR1, APCFZR1 earmarks BRAF for ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis, whereas in cancer cells with APC-free FZR1, FZR1 suppresses BRAF through disrupting BRAF dimerization. Moreover, we identified FZR1 as a direct target of ERK and CYCLIN D1/CDK4 kinases. Phosphorylation of FZR1 inhibits APCFZR1, leading to elevation of a cohort of oncogenic APCFZR1 substrates to facilitate melanomagenesis. Importantly, CDK4 and/or BRAF/MEK inhibitors restore APCFZR1 E3 ligase activity, which might be critical for their clinical effects. Furthermore, FZR1 depletion cooperates with AKT hyperactivation to transform primary melanocytes, whereas …"
339,In vitro studies of the regulation of microtubule assembly,1976,Stephen M Penningroth and Don W Cleveland and Marc W Kirschner,"Observations in eukaryotic cells in vivo suggest that the assembly of microtubules is regulated temporally and spatially in a variety of processes. The discovery by Weisenberg (1972) of conditions for repolymerizing microtubules from brain extracts made possible detailed investigations of the requirements for microtubule assembly in vitro. The major question raised by the in vitro experiments is which of the conditions, if any, that have been shown to modulate microtubule assembly in vitro actually acts in vivo to control the localization and growth of microtubule structures. This question will be difficult to resolve in detail. However, in vitro studies have already delineated a number of possible mechanisms for the regulation of microtubule assembly. In addition to suggesting likely control mechanisms, studies in the purified system have defined a pathway of assembly that raises interesting issues about interactions of …"
340,A nontranscriptional role for Oct4 in the regulation of mitotic entry,2014,Rui Zhao and Richard W Deibler and Paul H Lerou and Andrea Ballabeni and Garrett C Heffner and Patrick Cahan and Juli J Unternaehrer and Marc W Kirschner and George Q Daley,"Rapid progression through the cell cycle and a very short G1 phase are defining characteristics of embryonic stem cells. This distinct cell cycle is driven by a positive feedback loop involving Rb inactivation and reduced oscillations of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. In this setting, we inquired how ES cells avoid the potentially deleterious consequences of premature mitotic entry. We found that the pluripotency transcription factor Oct4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4) plays an unappreciated role in the ES cell cycle by forming a complex with cyclin–Cdk1 and inhibiting Cdk1 activation. Ectopic expression of Oct4 or a mutant lacking transcriptional activity recapitulated delayed mitotic entry in HeLa cells. Reduction of Oct4 levels in ES cells accelerated G2 progression, which led to increased chromosomal missegregation and apoptosis. Our data demonstrate an unexpected nontranscriptional …"
341,Microarray Discovery of New OGT Substrates: The Medulloblastoma Oncogene OTX2 Is O-GlcNAcylated,2014,Rodrigo F Ortiz-Meoz and Yifat Merbl and Marc W Kirschner and Suzanne Walker,"O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is a serine/threonine glycosyltransferase that is essential for development and continues to be critically important throughout life. Understanding OGT’s complex biology requires identifying its substrates. Here we demonstrate the utility of a microarray approach for discovering novel OGT substrates. We also report a rapid method to validate OGT substrates that combines in vitro transcription-translation with O-GlcNAc mass tagging. Among the validated new OGT targets is Orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2), a transcription factor critical for brain development, which is primarily expressed only during early embryogenesis and in medulloblastomas, where it functions as an oncogene. We show that endogenous OTX2 from a medulloblastoma cell line is O-GlcNAcylated at several sites. Our results demonstrate that protein microarray technology, combined with the target validation strategy we …"
342,Geminin deploys multiple mechanisms to regulate Cdt1 before cell division thus ensuring the proper execution of DNA replication,2013,Andrea Ballabeni and Raffaella Zamponi and Jodene K Moore and Kristian Helin and Marc W Kirschner,"Cdc10-dependent transcript 1 (Cdt1) is an essential DNA replication protein whose accumulation at the end of the cell cycle promotes the formation of pre-replicative complexes and replication in the next cell cycle. Geminin is thought to be involved in licensing replication by promoting the accumulation of Cdt1 in mitosis, because decreasing the Geminin levels prevents Cdt1 accumulation and impairs DNA replication. Geminin is known to inhibit Cdt1 function; its depletion during G2 leads to DNA rereplication and checkpoint activation. Here we show that, despite rapid Cdt1 protein turnover in G2 phase, Geminin promotes Cdt1 accumulation by increasing its RNA and protein levels in the unperturbed cell cycle. Therefore, Geminin is a master regulator of cell-cycle progression that ensures the timely onset of DNA replication and prevents its rereplication."

344,Regulation of microtubule and actin filament assembly-disassembly by associated small and large molecules,1983,Terrell L Hill and Marc W Kirschner,"This chapter studies the role of small molecules or proteins in perturbing the association–dissociation steady state of actin and tubulin. It discusses the effect of molecules that bind to monomers at the ends of filaments, the so-called capping proteins. The chapter also discusses differences between large structures that interact with several monomers on filament ends and therefore remain attached during assembly and disassembly of monomers and proteins or factors that bind to single monomers on the ends of filaments and do not remain attached to the monomers. This analysis provides an indication of the range of what capping proteins and binding proteins can achieve. The models proposed in the chapter are illustrative rather than exhaustive, and in some cases they have been chosen to reflect as closely as possible the properties of known factors."

346,Autoregulatory control of the expression of α-and β-tubulins: implications for microtubule assembly,1982,D Cleveland and M Kirschner,"Like all the major structural elements of the cytoskeleton, microtubules are assembled from protein subunits. It has become clear in work from a variety of investigations that for microtubules the polymeric form is generally in rapid equilibrium with the subunit form (here, the subunit form of tubulin will be considered to be the 105-dalton dimer of one a-polypeptide and one/3-polypeptide); hence, perturbations of extrinsic variables such as pressure and temperature can cause a rapid and reversible shift from one form to the other (see Inou6 and Sato 1965). The first in vitro studies of microtuble assembly indicated that polymerization could be described kinetically and thermodynamically as a simple condensation polymerization (Johnson and Borisy 1977). In this theory a single critical concentration for monomer exists. At a concentration of monomer above the critical concentration, polymerization occurs. The polymer …"

Biochemical screens using cell transfection or yeast two-hybrid methods are rapid, but they are limited by cDNA library quality. The recent establishment of “uni-gene sets” has made it feasible to biochemically screen an organism’s entire genome. Radiolabeled protein pools prepared from the Drosophila Gene Collection were used in a Drosophila in vitro expression cloning (“DIVEC”) screen for substrates of PAN GU kinase, which is crucial for S-M embryonic cell cycles. Ablation of one identified substrate, Mat89Bb, by RNAi produces a polyploid phenotype similar to that of pan gu mutants. Xenopus embryos injected with Mat89Bb morpholinos arrest with polyploid nuclei, and Mat89Bb RNAi in HeLa cells …"

Once a cell enters the cell cycle, metabolic machinery is engaged to facilitate various processes. The kinetics and regulation of these metabolic changes have not been properly evaluated. To correlate the orchestration of these processes with the cell cycle, we analyzed the transition from quiescence to proliferation of a non-malignant murine pro-B lymphocyte cell line in response to IL-3. Using multiplex mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, we show that the transition to proliferation shares features generally attributed to cancer cells: upregulation of glycolysis, lipid metabolism, amino-acid synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and the urea cycle. Furthermore, metabolomic profiling of this transition reveals similarities to cancer-related metabolic …"
352,Protein microarrays for genome‐wide posttranslational modification analysis,2011,Yifat Merbl and Marc W Kirschner,"Protein microarray technology has emerged as a powerful tool for comparing binding interactions, expression level, substrate specificities, and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of different proteins in a parallel and high‐throughput manner. The ability to immobilize proteins to a solid surface and register the specific address of each protein has bridged major limitations for investigating the proteome in biological samples, namely, the wide dynamic range of protein concentrations and the perturbation of the physical and chemical properties of proteins by their modification. Recent advances introduced the use of functional mammalian cell extracts to assay PTMs under different cellular conditions. This assay offers a new approach for performing large‐scale complex biochemical analysis of protein modifications. Here, we review studies of PTM profiling using protein microarrays and discuss the limitations and …"
353,Identification of ubiquitin ligase substrates by in vitro expression cloning,2005,Nagi G Ayad and Susannah Rankin and Danny Ooi and Michael Rape and Marc W Kirschner,"The number of identified E3 ubiquitin ligases has dramatically increased in recent years. However, the substrates targeted for degradation by these particular ligases have not been easily identified. One reason for the inability of matching substrates and ligases is the finding that E3 recognition elements in substrates are often poorly defined. This minimizes the likelihood that bioinformatic approaches will lead to the identification of E3 substrates. For example, the multi‐subunit complex the anaphase promoting complex (APC) is an E3 that recognizes destruction boxes (RXXLXXXXD/N/E) or KEN motifs within substrates (Glotzer et al., 1991; Pfleger and Kirschner, 2000). However, many proteins that contain either a potential destruction or a KEN motif are not recognized by the APC in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that there are other, less well‐defined characteristics of substrates that contribute to their ability to serve as …"
354,Use of an oocyte expression assay to reconstitute inductive signaling,1995,Kevin D Lustig and Marc W Kirschner,"We have developed a paracrine signaling assay capable of mimicking inductive events in the early vertebrate embryo. RNA encoding one or more secreted proteins is microinjected into a Xenopus laevis oocyte. After a brief incubation to allow translation, a piece of embryonic tissue competent to respond to the signaling protein is grafted onto the oocyte. The secreted protein9s effect on the grafted explant is then scored by assaying expression of tissue-specific markers. Explants of ectodermal tissue from blastula or gastrula stage embryos were grafted onto oocytes that had been injected with RNA encoding activin or noggin. We found that the paracrine assay faithfully reconstitutes mesoderm induction by activin and neural induction by noggin. Blastula-stage explants grafted onto activin-expressing oocytes expressed the mesodermal marker genes brachyury, goosecoid, and muscle actin. Gastrula-stage explants …"

A key event in base assembly is the formation of a heterohexameric ring of AAA-ATPases, which is guided by at least four RP assembly chaperones in mammals: PAAF1, p28/gankyrin, p27/PSMD9, and S5b. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we analyzed the non-AAA structure of the p28-bound human RP at 4.5 Å resolution and determined seven distinct conformations of the Rpn1-p28-AAA subcomplex within the p28-bound RP at subnanometer resolutions. Remarkably, the p28-bound AAA ring does not form a channel in the free RP and spontaneously samples multiple “open” and “closed” topologies at the Rpt2-Rpt6 and Rpt3-Rpt4 interfaces. Our analysis suggests that p28 assists the proteolytic core particle to select a specific conformation of the ATPase ring for RP engagement and …"
356,Assay and reagents for detecting inhibitors of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins,1998,Marc W Kirschner and Randall W King and Jan-Michael Peters,"The present invention provides a systematic and practical approach for the identification of candidate agents able to inhibit ubiquitin-mediated degradation of a cell-cycle regu latory protein, such as cyclins. One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for identifying an inhibitor of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of a cell-cycle regulatory protein by (i) providing a ubiquitin-conjugating system that includes the regulatory protein and ubiquitin under condi tions which promote the ubiquitination of the target protein, and (ii) measuring the level of ubiquitination of the subject protein brought about by the system in the presence and absence of a candidate agent. A decrease in the level of ubiquitin conjugation is indicative of an inhibitory activity for the candidate agent. The level of ubiquitination of the regulatory protein can be measured by determining the actual concentration of protein: ubiquitin conjugates formed …"
358,Microtubule-associated tau protein induction by nerve growth factor during neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells,1984,David Drubin and Marc Kirschner and Stuart Feinstein,"Undifferentiated PC12 cells display a rounded morphology and are about 9 microns in diameter. When these cells are cultured in NGF for 1 week, many neurite processes appear that can be over 500 microns in length. The maintenance of the neurite network is dependent on the continued presence of NGF and requires intact microtubules. When NGF is removed from the culture for 1-2 days, or when microtubule-depolymerizing drugs are added to the culture for 2 hours, the neurite network disappears.We might imagine that the formation of microtubule-filled processes could be caused either by a rearrangement of existing microtubules or by the polymerization of new microtubules. We can distinguish these possibilities by determining whether there is a change in microtubule polymer mass during neurite outgrowth. To measure the polymer mass, free of the soluble tubulin, detergent-extracted cytoskeletons were prepared under microtubule-stabilizing conditions, and the tubulin content of the cytoskeletons was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies against tubulin. Figure 1 shows a Western blot (Burnette 1981) of detergent-extracted PC12 cytoskeletons stained with a polyclonal tubulin antiserum. The center lane shows the polymer tubulin in undifferentiated PC12 cells. The tubulin signal is barely visible. In contrast, the first lane shows the polymer tubulin from a parallel culture treated for 1 hour with taxol, a drug that drives free tubulin into microtubules. Clearly, much more tubulin is now in the cytoskeleton fraction, implying that a large pool of unpolymerized tubulin that is normally extracted exists in undifferentiated PC12 cells. The last …"
359,Anteroposterior axis patterning by early canonical Wnt signaling during hemichordate development,2018,Sébastien Darras and Jens H Fritzenwanker and Kevin R Uhlinger and Ellyn Farrelly and Ariel M Pani and Imogen A Hurley and Rachael P Norris and Michelle Osovitz and Mark Terasaki and Mike Wu and Jochanan Aronowicz and Marc Kirschner and John C Gerhart and Christopher J Lowe,"The Wnt family of secreted proteins has been proposed to play a conserved role in early specification of the bilaterian anteroposterior (A/P) axis. This hypothesis is based predominantly on data from vertebrate embryogenesis as well as planarian regeneration and homeostasis, indicating that canonical Wnt (cWnt) signaling endows cells with positional information along the A/P axis. Outside of these phyla, there is strong support for a conserved role of cWnt signaling in the repression of anterior fates, but little comparative support for a conserved role in promotion of posterior fates. We further test the hypothesis by investigating the role of cWnt signaling during early patterning along the A/P axis of the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. We have cloned and investigated the expression of the complete Wnt ligand and Frizzled receptor complement of S. kowalevskii during early development along with many secreted Wnt modifiers. Eleven of the 13 Wnt ligands are ectodermally expressed in overlapping domains, predominantly in the posterior, and Wnt antagonists are localized predominantly to the anterior ectoderm in a pattern reminiscent of their distribution in vertebrate embryos. Overexpression and knockdown experiments, in combination with embryological manipulations, establish the importance of cWnt signaling for repression of anterior fates and activation of mid-axial ectodermal fates during the early development of S. kowalevskii. However, surprisingly, terminal posterior fates, defined by posterior Hox genes, are unresponsive to manipulation of cWnt levels during the early establishment of the A/P axis at late blastula and early …"
363,Neuronal Differentiation and Patterning inXenopus: The Role of cdk5 and a Novel Activator Xp35. 2,1999,A Philpott and L-H Tsai and MW Kirschner,"Cdk5, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, has been shown to play an important role in development of the central nervous system in mammals when partnered by its activator p35. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel activator of cdk5 inXenopus,Xp35.2. Xp35.2 is expressed during development initially in the earliest differentiating primary neurons in the neural plate and then later in differentiating neural tissue of the brain. This is in contrast to the previously describedXenopuscdk5 activator Xp35.1 which is expressed over the entire expanse of the neural plate in both proliferating and differentiating cells. Expression of both Xp35.1 and Xp35.2 and activation of cdk5 kinase occur when terminal neural differentiation is induced by neurogenin and neuro D overexpression but not when only early stages of neural differentiation are induced by noggin. Moreover, blocking cdk5 kinase …"
364,A perverted view of “impact”,2013,Marc Kirschner,"Scientists often face vexing professional decisions: whom to hire, what to fund, what to publish, and whom to promote. Because science is about the unknown and its greatest discoveries are often the least expected, scientists often have little to go by except intuition and experience. For this reason, a seductively simple template has recently been introduced: assessment based on “impact and significance.” Thus, the U.S. National Institutes of Health has elevated “significance” to an explicit criterion in funding decisions. It requires that grant reviewers write a paragraph on “impact,” which it defines as the likelihood that the proposed work will have a “sustained and powerful influence.”* Especially in fundamental research, which historically underlies the greatest innovation, the people doing the work often cannot themselves anticipate the ways in which it may bring human benefit.

Consideration is given to the orientation of the mask either symmetrically about a radius or offset with one slit along a radius from the center of rotation, to the placement of the mask above or below the rotor, to the use of a second pair of slits in the cell to mask imperfections in the cell windows, and to certain aberrations arising from variations in the refractive index across the width of the slit and from deviation of light perpendicular to the slits by a component of the radial refractive index gradients. Optimal mask dimensions for different experimental conditions for both symmetrical and offset masks are given. Equations based on the geometry of the cells and mask are derived, permitting calculations sufficient to align correctly a symmetrical mask with minimal labor.Two lower-mask …"

The class Scyphozoa, or true jellyfish, are characterized by a predominant medusa life-stage consisting of a bell and venomous tentacles used for hunting and defense, as well as using pulsed jet propulsion for mobility. Here, we present the genome of the giant Nomura’s jellyfish (Nemopilema nomurai) to understand the genetic basis of these key innovations. We sequenced the genome and transcriptomes of the bell and tentacles of the giant Nomura’s jellyfish as well as transcriptomes across tissues and developmental stages of the Sanderia malayensis jellyfish. Analyses of the Nemopilema and other cnidarian genomes revealed adaptations associated with swimming, marked by codon bias in muscle contraction and expansion of neurotransmitter genes, along with expanded Myosin type II family and venom domains, possibly contributing to jellyfish mobility and active predation. We also identified gene family expansions of Wnt and posterior Hox genes and discovered the important role of retinoic acid signaling in this ancient lineage of metazoans, which together may be related to the unique jellyfish body plan (medusa formation). Taken together, the Nemopilema jellyfish genome and transcriptomes genetically confirm their unique morphological and physiological traits, which may have contributed to the success of jellyfish as early multi-cellular predators."
372,Kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates,2017,Michael W Susman and Edith P Karuna and Ryan C Kunz and Taranjit S Gujral and Andrea V Cantú and Shannon S Choi and Brigette Y Jong and Kyoko Okada and Michael K Scales and Jennie Hum and Linda S Hu and Marc W Kirschner and Ryuichi Nishinakamura and Soichiro Yamada and Diana J Laird and Li-En Jao and Steven P Gygi and Michael E Greenberg and Hsin-Yi Henry Ho,"Wnt5a-Ror signaling constitutes a developmental pathway crucial for embryonic tissue morphogenesis, reproduction and adult tissue regeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which the Wnt5a-Ror pathway mediates these processes are largely unknown. Using a proteomic screen, we identify the kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b as a downstream target of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway. Wnt5a-Ror, through a process independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway, regulates the cellular stability of Kif26b by inducing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Through this mechanism, Kif26b modulates the migratory behavior of cultured mesenchymal cells in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. Genetic perturbation of Kif26b function in vivo caused embryonic axis malformations and depletion of primordial germ cells in the developing gonad, two phenotypes characteristic of disrupted Wnt5a-Ror signaling. These findings indicate that Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of morphogenetic cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates and reveal a new role for regulated proteolysis in noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror signal transduction."

The authors review recent experiments on the acquisition of bilateral symmetry and initiation of the cell cycle.
376,Spatial and temporal changes in early amphibian development,1980,KA Butner and JW Newport and MW Kirschner and SD Black and JC Gerhart and SR Scharf,"Following fertilization in Xenopus eggs, the dorsal-ventral asymmetry of the egg is established and a rapid cell cycle is begun. In the mid to late blastula period this initial asymmetry is translated into differentiation of the dorsal mesoderm initiated by the vegetal dorsalizing center; as suggested by experiments of Nieuwkoop. About this time the cell cycle undergoes a modification coincident with several events including the onset of cell motility. We report here on experiments describing how the dorsal-ventral asymmetry is produced in the early period. In particular we discuss the role of the sperm, its associated aster, the cortex, and redistribution of cytoplasmic contents. This analysis furthers our understanding of UV effects on dorsalization and the mechanism of twinning. We report also on evidence for a cytoplasmic clock regulating the cycle of DNA synthesis and cytokinesis in early cleavage, as well as on further …"

It is important to identify additional therapeutic targets in ccRCC downstream of VHL loss besides hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α). By performing a genome-wide screen, we identified Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 1 (SFMBT1) as a candidate pVHL target. SFMBT1 was considered to be a transcriptional repressor but its role in cancer remains unclear. ccRCC patients with VHL loss-of-function mutations displayed elevated SFMBT1 protein levels. SFMBT1 hydroxylation on Proline residue 651 by EglN1 mediated its ubiquitination and degradation governed by pVHL. Depletion of SFMBT1 abolished ccRCC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited orthotopic tumor growth in vivo.

383,Autoregulation of tubulin synthesis,1986,Joan M Caron and Marc W Kirschner,"In many mammalian cell types, increases in the level of nonpolymerized tubulin cause an inhibition in tubulin synthesis which is accompanied by a decrease in tubulin mRNA levels. To see whether inhibition is caused by nuclear or cytoplasmic events, two groups have recently examined the ability of enucleated cells to autoregulate tubulin synthesis.1,2 These experiments have demonstrated that transcription, processing, and transport of tubulin mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm are not major sites of autoregulation. Instead, monomeric tubulin must reduce, either directly or indirectly, the translatability of its own message."

Biochemical fractionation and candidate screening experiments conducted in the extract system have identified the Arp2/3 complex, the N‐WASP‐WIP (or N‐WASP‐CR16) complex, and the Cdc42‐binding protein Toca‐1 as important mediators of PIP2‐ and Cdc42‐actin signaling. Toward our ultimate goal of reconstituting an in vitro system that recapitulates the signaling properties observed in vivo, we then developed a purified actin assembly assay system consisting of the regulatory components that we discovered from extracts. In these assays, the stereotypical sigmoidal kinetics of actin polymerization are monitored by pyrene‐actin fluorescence in the presence of defined recombinant or purified proteins, enabling the detailed …"
386,Quantitative measurement of the catastrophe rate of dynamic microtubules,1999,Bin‐Bing Zhou and Marc W Kirschner,"Previous work has shown that catastrophe frequency is the predominant dynamic parameter of microtubules that changes dramatically during the cell cycle. As an alternative to videomicroscopy assays, we have developed a biochemical assay to measure directly the average catastrophe rate of a population of microtubules. In this assay, the growing plus end of the microtubules, polymerized off seeds, are labeled with a brief pulse of α‐32P‐GTP, followed by a cold GTP chase. The rate of loss of 32P label in microtubules measured by this method is equal to the catastrophe frequency at microtubule plus ends measured by videomicroscopy of individual microtubules. Addition of mitotic extract from Xenopus eggs increases the catastrophe rate of purified tubulin by almost 100‐fold, while interphase extract alters the catastrophe rate by about 20‐fold as compared to pure tubulin. Most of the catastrophe‐promoting …"
387,Cytoplasm and cell motility overview.,1989,M Kirschner and K Weber,"It is always difficult to look at recent history and predict the future. In this volume, however, it is unmistakably clear that the future course of cell biology is intimately tied to understanding the structure and organization of the cell, and that much of this understanding will be won on the battlefields of cytoskeletal research. There will be several important theaters of operations and several new technologies to be employed, but the overall goals are still the same as the original ones: the understanding of global features of cell behavior including cell movement, cell division, cell differentiation, and multicellular interactions in tissue formation.The footsoldiers in these campaigns are still the major structural cytoskeletal proteins themselves. Though regulatory molecules and associated factors will modify their activities, many of the properties of the polymers will be determined by the intrinsic properties of the major subunits. It is clear that, unfortunately, we still don't understand clearly what these activities are. In the past few years the intrinsic dynamic properties of these simple structural polymers have been investigated by using new methodologies. The structural basis for dynamic instability and oscillations in microtubules remains an important area of study for both cell morphogenesis and mitosis. Yet, we still lack detailed structures for tubulin and its associated proteins. Intermediate filaments have become more dynamic and responsive and it is becoming clear that their remodelling is under cell cycle control, and subject to phosphorylation reactions that may regulate assembly. The beginnings of an understanding of how their overall morphology is regulated …"
388,Microtubule dynamics and cellular morphogenesis,1984,TJ Mitchison and MW Kirschner,"The problem of understanding morphogenesis on a cellular level is much more complicated than the problem of understanding the self-assembly of crystals, viruses, or even complex oligomeric structures. On a microscopic level, the in-dividual components of the cell such as the membrane or cytoskeletal systems probably assemble by the usual rather restrictive rules of crystallographic sym-metry, relaxed a little by quasi-equivalence (Caspar and Klug 1963). However, on a macroscopic level the assemblage of these structures must be extremely plas-tic. It must, for example, respond quickly to changes in growth conditions or to developmental stimuli. It must also be capable of being remodeled into many forms, representing different cell types and states while utilizing as major struc-tural components the same elements. This problem is well exemplified by micro-tubules, whose surface lattice does not seem to vary from cell to cell (or in gen-eral from organism to organism) but whose organization varies profoundly during the cell cycle of a given cell. The fundamental question peculiar to the macro-scopic organization of the cytoskeleton is, By what means does the cell localize polymerization in certain positions and along certain directions and at the same time prevent random polymerization of cytoskeletal elements?"

In most current models, Dvl forms complexes with Wnt ligand receptors, Fzd and LRP5/6 at the plasma membrane, which then recruits the destruction complex, eventually leading to inactivation of β-catenin degradation. Although this model is widespread, direct evidence for the individual steps is lacking. In this study, we tagged mEGFP to C terminus of dishevelled2 gene using CRISPR/Cas9-induced homologous recombination and observed its dynamics directly at the single-molecule level with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We focused on two questions: 1) What is the native size and what are the dynamic features of membrane-bound Dvl complexes during Wnt pathway activation? 2) What controls the behavior of these complexes? We found that membrane-bound Dvl2 is predominantly …"

We analyze the dynamics of the propagating front as a function of physical-chemical properties of the host medium. The anisotropy of the medium significantly affects the smoothness of the wave front. Similarly, if particles or molecules may diffuse slowly to neighboring sites, then the front wave is more likely to be irregular. Both situations affect the ability of the whole system to relax to the original state, which is a required feature in the biological cells. Attempts to map this simple reaction scheme to reactions involved in the intracellular pathways suggest that, in some cases, signal transduction might take both connotation of a random walk and a propagating wave, depending on the local density of the medium. In particular, a sufficient condition for the appearance of waves in high-density regions of the …"

We derived a method to assay whether growth rates of individual cells depend on cell size, by combining time-lapse microscopy and immunofluorescence to monitor how variance in cell size changes as cells grow. This analysis revealed two periods in the cell cycle when cell size variance decreases in a manner incompatible with unregulated growth, suggesting that cells sense their own size and adjust their growth rate to correct aberrations. Monitoring nuclear growth in live cells confirmed that these decreases in variance reflect a process that selectively inhibits the growth of large cells while accelerating growth of small cells. We also detected cell-size-dependent adjustments of G1 length, which further reduce variability. Combining our assays with chemical and genetic perturbations confirmed that cells employ two strategies, adjusting both cell cycle length and growth rate, to maintain the appropriate size."
399,Validation of functional insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 measurement by a ligand immunoassay.,2010,M Langkamp and K Weber and M Kirschner and L Pridzun and MB Ranke,"BACKGROUND: Proteolysis of Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein (IGFBP)--3 is a well known mechanism regulating IGF-I bioavailability and IGF-independent actions of IGFBP-3 fragments. Measurement of functional IGFBP-3 can be of use in diagnostics of growth failure or renal impairment. We herein characterize the properties of a commercially available immunoassay for the measurement of functional (IGF-I binding) IGFBP-3. METHOD: Fragmentation of IGFBP-3 is analyzed by gel filtration, SDS-PAGE, and western ligand and immunoblotting and compared with subsequent measurement of total and functional IGFBP-3 by ELISA/IFA. Furthermore, assay characteristics such as reproducibility, linearity, and sensitivity are surveyed. RESULTS: Functional IGFBP-3 was reproducibly measured (6.8/5.6% Inter-/Intra assay variance). A broad range of linearity (1: 50-1: 300) and a high sensitivity (0.18 microg/L) allowed reliable measurement of IGF-binding IGFBP-3. Analysis of IGFBP-3 fragments reveals that the assay described only detects intact IGFBP-3. Analysis of 189 serum samples from healthy blood donors showed that on average 84% and 69% of total IGFBP-3 was functional in men and women, respectively (p< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Functional IGFBP-3 can be measured reliably by the assay system used. Thus, this assay system is suited for the investigation of the diagnostic value of functional IGFBP-3 in human body fluids."

The African frog Xenopus laevis, the amphibian most widely used today, owes much of its popularity to its robustness and facility of husbandry, the ready availability of oocytes and eggs in large quantities, and the ease with which cell and tissue manipulations can be performed. These features allow many embryological experiments that are difficult or not possible in other model organisms. Compared with other vertebrate embryos, Xenopus embryos are large and accessible for manipulation from fertilization onward, and many of the early patterning processes have proven generalizable to all vertebrates. The great limitation of the frog has been in genetic manipulability. Ectopic expression of injected RNA is very simple and has yielded a wealth of information.

Here we experimentally interrogated 553 candidates selected from noncanonical ORF datasets. Of these, 57 induced viability defects when knocked out in human cancer cell lines. Following ectopic expression, 257 showed evidence of protein expression and 401 induced gene expression changes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) tiling and start codon mutagenesis indicated that their biological effects required translation as opposed to RNA-mediated effects. We found that one of these ORFs, G029442—renamed glycine-rich extracellular protein-1 (GREP1)—encodes a secreted protein highly expressed in breast cancer, and its knockout in 263 cancer cell lines showed preferential essentiality in breast cancer …"

In addition, such measurements provide the basis for interpreting data from difference sedimentation velocity experiments since changes in sedimentation coefficients are due to either alterations in fric-tional coefficients or to shifts in association-dissociation equi-libria involving monomers and oligomers. Since very small changes in molecular weight can be determined only indirectly from separate experiments and conventional methods have lim-ited accuracy, we have developed a difference sedimentation equilibrium technique forthe direct measurement of differ-ences in effective molecular weight ().

This ambiguity can be eliminated, in part, by combining measurements of the change in sedimentationcoefficient, As, at one protein concentration with data for the effect of the ligand on the concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficient, di/dc. Equations are presented relating As at a single protein concentration to a ligand-promoted shift in the association constant for a monomer-dimer system.

Only the genetic components are inherited. The genes though responsive to the mutagenic potential of the environment cannot respond directly to the characteristics of the selective environment, except perhaps by changing the rate of random variation. What Jablonka and Lamb ask is whether our new knowledge of stable epigenetic inheritance, both within cell lineages and in transgenerational inheritance, fundamentally changes our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. Their first argument is that epigenetic mechanisms have played an important role in metazoan evolution. This is both undoubtedly correct and in a sense unremarkable. Since the size of genomes and most likely the number of genes has …"

When there is tissue damage, YAP is activated allowing the restoration of homeostatic tissue size. The exact signals by which YAP is activated are still not fully understood, but its activation is known to affect both cell size and cell number. Here we used cultured cells to examine the coordinated regulation of cell size and number under the control of YAP. Our experiments in isogenic HEK293 cells reveal that YAP can affect cell size and number by independent circuits. Some of these effects are cell autonomous, such as proliferation, while others are mediated by secreted signals. In particular CYR61, a known secreted YAP target, is a non-cell autonomous mediator of cell survival, while another unidentified secreted factor controls cell size."

The ability to screen binding interactions as well as post‐translational modifications of thousands of proteins at once has improved our ability to identify their targets. Utilizing such systems in combination with functional mammalian cell extracts that preserve enzymatic activity offers advantages in identifying semi‐quantitative changes of these interactions in the context of specific cellular conditions. This unit provides a detailed procedure for setting up an extract‐based activity assay for high content detection of protein post‐translation modifications.

424,YAP independently regulates cell size and population growth dynamics via non-cell autonomous mediators,2018,Douaa Mugahid and Marian Kalocsay and Scott Gruver and Leonid Peshkin and Marc W Kirschner,"The Hippo pathway, in which changes at the cell surface and in the extracellular environment control the activity of a downstream transcription factor, known as YAP in mammalian cells and Yorkie in Drosophila, has recently taken center-stage as perhaps the most important pathway in metazoans for controlling organ size. In intact tissues YAP activity is inhibited and the organ does not overgrow. When the organ is damaged, YAP is active and necessary for growth and regeneration to occur. The exact process by which YAP drives organ and tissue growth is not fully understood, although it is known to affect both cell size and cell number. Since cell size and proliferation are highly interdependent in many cultured cell studies, we investigated the role of YAP in the simultaneous regulation of both cell size and number. Our experiments reveal that YAP controls both cell size and cell proliferation by independent circuits, and that it affects each process non-cell autonomously via extracellular mediators. We identify that CYR61, a known secreted YAP target, is the major regulator of the non-cell autonomous increase in cell number, but does not affect cell size. The molecular identity of the non-cell autonomously acting mediator of cell size is yet to be identified."

Although others have raised similar questions about the creation of the phenotypic landscape on which selection acts, the discovery of the molecular details about the genotype-phenotype relationship, and, in particular, the means by which the genotype is converted to the phenotype, provided the materials for a perspective on evolution that diverges significantly from the Modern Synthesis, which assumed the sufficiency of population genetics to explain all of evolution.

We have reconstituted actin assembly in response to these signals in Xenopus extracts and examined the relationship of these pathways. We have found that GTPγS stimulates actin assembly in the presence of endogenous membrane vesicles in low speed extracts. These membrane vesicles are required, but can be replaced by lipid vesicles prepared from purified phospholipids containing phosphoinositides. Vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) trisphosphate can induce actin assembly even in the absence of GTPγS. RhoGDI, a guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for the Rho family, inhibits phosphoinositide-induced actin assembly, suggesting the involvement of the Rho family small G proteins.

We show the utility of this dataset with an improved version of Kinome Regularization (KiR) to deconvolve protein kinases involved in a cellular phenotype. We assayed protein kinase inhibitors against more than 70 % of the human protein kinome and chose an optimal subset of 58 inhibitors to assay at ten doses across four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate KiR utility using a quantitative cell migration assay and updated machine learning methods. This approach can be widely applied to biological problems for which a quantitative phenotype can be measured and which can be perturbed with our kinase inhibitors."

Lack of sufficient accuracy in the measurement of the growth rate of adherent cells through the cell cycle has thwarted the understanding of how such cell populations maintain a stable size distribution. The accuracy of Quantitative Phase Microscopy (QPM) is just shy of the accuracy needed to resolve the principle features of mammalian cell growth and perhaps to reveal new ones. Based on our analysis of the source of errors in QPM we both improved image processing algorithms and automated cell tracking software, making it suitable for longitudinal and large scale applications. Using these tools we revealed a remarkable a series of episodes of the convergence of cell growth rate, which may play a large role in the control of cell size variability."

Some people may prefer the perspective of genes, molecular structure, physiology, or cladistics. But when I start from the perspective of cellular function, I feel I have the best panorama of life. I appreciate the molecular underpinnings, the process of embryonic development, the diverse uses of transcription and metabolism, the anatomical changes in ontogeny and phylogeny, physiological adaptability, and homeostasis. Even evolution, perhaps the most general theory in all of biology, seems less formal and pedantic when I can appreciate what it is about cells that allows for so much selectable variation.

A brief examination of the recent history of microtubules reveals an ever increasing complexity of each component in the system. Lurking behind the question of what regulates tubulin assembly in the cell are still the basic questions of how many gene products there are for the tubulins, whether different forms are significantly distinct in their functional properties, and whether there is selective gene expression. There is already evidence for widespread microheterogeneity in tubulin based on analysis of 2-D gels and additionally on some preliminary genetic data (Kemphues et al. 1979). Since with the exception of the genetic evidence such heterogeneity may be post-translational or even artifactual …"

Its study has been thwarted by difficulties in the accurate measurement of cell size and the even greater challenges of measuring growth of a single cell over time. We address these limitations by demonstrating a computationally enhanced methodology for quantitative phase microscopy for adherent cells, using improved image processing algorithms and automated cell-tracking software. Accuracy has been improved more than twofold and this improvement is sufficient to establish the dynamics of cell growth and adherence to simple growth laws. It is also sufficient to reveal unknown features of cell growth, previously unmeasurable.

The tools of annotating single cell data and creating knowledge representations comparable across organisms have been lagging. We argue that successfully creating Cell Atlases will require a revival of a boot‐camp style forum for communal annotation combined with an intensive learning workshop, dubbed a “Jamboree”.

456,A visit to the Hubrecht laboratory.,2004,MARC Kirschner,"At that time I was at Princeton University and I had planned to spend part of my sabbatical, jointly with John Gerhart, who was at Berkeley, investigating some aspects of early development in Xenopus at the Hubrecht Laboratory in Utrecht. By 1978 some areas of biology had moved forward at great speed, spurred by molecular biology, but others like embryology still seemed to be mired in vague premolecular concepts, such as induction, competence or regulative development. The scene at the Hubrecht in those days was a curious one. It seemed to John and me that the Institution was dedicated to the most interesting unsolved problems in developmental biology and with its emphasis on Xenopus it employed one of the best systems to answer them. Yet compared to most laboratories, the Hubrecht was unusually focused in descriptive morphology and lacked the modern core of molecular biology and biochemistry found in most places. For us, the descriptive morphology was just what we were lacking. We particularly enjoyed talking to Pieter Nieuwkoop, who at that time seemed rather disconnected from the other work going on. John and I soon discovered that he had performed a wealth of fascinating experiments with Elze Boterenbrood on the mechanism of mesoderm and neural induction, experiments that have a continuing influence today. We would sit with him at lunch with our open faced ham and cheese sandwiches, imbibing the lore of induction and germ cell formation and trying to connect to a tradition of experimental embryology that was almost completely gone John and I were identified as cell biologists and biochemists, and assumed …"

Recently, treadmilling has been challenged by the dynamic instability model of Mitchison and Kirschner.* In this model the majority of the MTs grow at a moderate rate at both ends. This set of growing MTs is balanced at steady state by the very rapid disassembly of a minority of the MTs. The difference between the growing or shrinking MT states may be due to the presence or absence of tubulin (Tb)-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) subunits at the polymer ends. Tb-GTP ends have slow dissociation rates and tend to grow at steady state, whereas TB-guanosine diphosphate (GDP) ends …"

In vertebrates there are two forms of Axin, Axin1 and Axin2, which are similar at the protein level and genetically redundant.  We show here that differential regulation of the two genes on the transcriptional and proteostatic level confers robustness and differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments."
479,One-Seq: A Highly Scalable Sequencing-Based Diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 and Other Single-Stranded Viruses,2021,Mingjie Dai and Wenzhe Ma and Hong Kang and Matthew Sonnett and George M Church and Marc W Kirschner,"The management of pandemics such as COVID-19 requires highly scalable and sensitive viral diagnostics, together with variant identification. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has many attractive features for highly multiplexed testing, however current sequencing-based methods are limited in throughput by early processing steps on individual samples (e.g. RNA extraction and PCR amplification). Here we report a new method, ""One-Seq"", that eliminates the current bottlenecks in scalability by enabling early pooling of samples, before any extraction or amplification steps. To enable early pooling, we developed a one-pot reaction for efficient reverse transcription (RT) and upfront barcoding in extraction-free clinical samples, and a ""protector"" strategy in which carefully designed competing oligonucleotides prevent barcode crosstalk and preserve detection of the high dynamic range of viral load in clinical samples. This method is highly sensitive, achieving a limit of detection (LoD) down to 2.5 genome copy equivalent (gce) in contrived RT samples, 10 gce in multiplexed sequencing, and 2-5 gce with multi-primer detection, suggesting an LoD of 200-500 gce/ml for clinical testing. In clinical specimens, One-Seq showed quantitative viral detection against clinical Ct values with 6 logs of linear dynamic range and detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples down to ~360 gce/ml. In addition, One-Seq reports a number of hotspot viral mutations at equal scalability at no extra cost. Scaling up One-Seq would allow a throughput of 100,000-1,000,000 tests per day per single clinical lab, at an estimated amortized reagent cost of $1.5 per test and turn …"
480,Identification of Kinases Activated by Multiple Pro-Angiogenic Growth Factors,2021,Scott Gruver and Scott Rata and Leonid Peshkin and Marc Kirschner,"Antiangiogenic therapy began as an effort to inhibit VEGF signaling, which was thought to be the sole factor driving tumor angiogenesis. It has become clear that there are more pro-angiogenic growth factors that can substitute for VEGF during tumor vascularization. This has led to the development of multi-kinase inhibitors which simultaneously target multiple growth factor receptors. These inhibitors perform better than monotherapies yet to date no multi-kinase inhibitor targets all receptors known to be involved in pro-angiogenic signaling and resistance inevitably occurs. Given the large number of pro-angiogenic growth factors identified, it may be impossible to simultaneously target all pro-angiogenic growth factor receptors. Here we search for kinase targets, some which may be intracellularly localized, that are critical in endothelial cell proliferation irrespective of the growth factor used. We develop a quantitative endothelial cell proliferation assay and combine it with ""kinome regression"" or KIR, a recently developed method capable of identifying kinases that influence a quantitative phenotype. We report the kinases implicated by KIR and provide orthogonal evidence of their importance in endothelial cell proliferation. Our approach points to a new strategy to develop a more complete anti-angiogenic blockade."

This personal retrospective focuses on how biochemical studies of the frog egg helped identify the cyclin-based mitotic oscillator and how this approach quickly merged with genetic studies in yeast to establish the basic mechanism of the eukaryotic cell division cycle. The key feature that made this a cyclic process was regulated protein degradation, mediated by ubiquitin, catalyzed by a massive enzyme machine, called the Anaphase Promoting Complex."

Diverse extracellular signals such as growth factors, hormones, nutrients, and cell-to-cell contact are transduced by the signaling pathway to regulate growth. Yet it is still an open question how the integration of diverse inputs results in cell growth or maintains cells at the right size in the face of massive protein turnover. Accurate measurement of cell size is critical for probing these questions. State-of-art techniques such as quantitative phase microscopy, suspended microchannel resonator, and novel fluorescence reporter made it possible to measure cellular dry mass in higher precision and throughput than ever. Nevertheless, the existing methods require suspended cells or in vitro cell cultures by which the contextual information of the tissue is lost. While the cell volume can be measured by confocal …"

One of the first animals to become free-swimming, jellyfish employ pulsed jet propulsion and venomous tentacles to capture prey.To understand these key innovations, we sequenced the genome of the giant Nomura’s jellyfish (Nemopilema nomurai), the transcriptomes of its bell and tentacles, and transcriptomes across tissues and developmental stages of the Sanderia malayensis jellyfish. Analyses of Nemopilema and other cnidarian genomes revealed adaptations associated with swimming, marked by codon bias in muscle contraction and expansion of neurotransmitter genes, along with expanded Myosin type II family and venom domains; possibly contributing to jellyfish mobility and active predation. We also identified gene family expansions of Wnt and posterior Hox genes, and discovered the important role of retinoic acid signaling in this ancient lineage of metazoans, which together may be related to the unique jellyfish body plan (medusa formation).Taken together, the jellyfish genome and transcriptomes genetically confirm their unique morphological and physiological traits that have combined to make these animals one of the world’s earliest and most successful multi-cellular predators."

496,Abstract A115: A novel therapy targeting Wnt receptor in metastatic solid tumors,2015,Taran Gujral and Marc Kirschner,"Metastasis is responsible for as much as 90% of cancer-associated mortality; yet progress has remained slow in developing effective drugs either specifically targeting metastasis or targeting cells with metastatic potential. To date, surgical resection is considered the best treatment for most cancers; however, it provides limited benefit in metastatic cancers. Although there are numerous studies showing the migratory potential of metastatic cells and relating metastasis to the biology of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), little is known about how tumor cells engage this fundamental cellular program. We have recently discovered a new non-canonical Wnt pathway through Wnt5-Fzd2 that drives EMT, cellular migration, invasion in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Using focused proteomics approaches, we have identified several novel signaling proteins downstream of Fzd2, including Fyn, Stat3 …"

The Sources of Variation,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"Darwin’s theory of evolution was perhaps the most ambitious effort to understand the living world, but unlike the others it was historically based and hard to test experimentally. Even to be comprehensible, it required an accumulation of knowledge from natural history, genetics, and paleontology. Biology differed from physics in that its most obvious characteristics are complexity and diversity; therefore the origin of that complexity and diversity would remain at the center of biological concerns. At the end of the nineteenth century, evolution was an unfinished, still controversial theory. An explanation of the origin of variation was one of the big gaps. The incompleteness of the theory was a problem for all of biology; biologists would continually return to it to add their perspectives."
515,"Two. Conserved Cells, Divergent Organisms",2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"SSewall Wright, who with JBS Haldane and RA Fisher established population genetics in the early twentieth century, asserted that beneath the anatomical changes in evolution are changes in what he called adaptive cell behavior. He thereby alleviated some of the difficulties of imagining the evolution of complex organisms. Yet his assertion avoids the obvious next question: What is “adaptive cell behavior”? We now know that the cell has hundreds of behaviors or activities that involve conserved core processes. When a significant change occurs in evolution, do radically new behaviors develop or does the cell use its existing repertoire in different ways? To understand evolutionary change in Wright’s terms, we want to know the historical changes that have occurred in cell behaviors and trace these modifications to the large-scale changes in anatomy that have traditionally been used to document evolutionary …"

Weak Regulatory Linkage,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"In deepening the inquiry, we introduce the fact that all the conserved core processes possess adaptability, which they use in response to varying conditions inside the organism rather than to identifiable external conditions, although they can do that as well. We ask the same question as before: How can these core processes facilitate the generation of novel variation in evolution? The core processes reveal conservation and economy. On the conservation side is evidence that the genes encoding the RNAs and proteins of these processes are highly conserved across diverse animals, from jellyfish to humans. We have seen that the core processes were established in several great waves of innovation, and since then they have remained basically unchanged. On the economy side is recognition of just how few genes a complex organism has to work with—only 22,500 in humans, about one and a half times those of a …"

Invisible Anatomy,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"Complex anatomy has not been achieved on the level of the single cell and hence emerged only with multicellularity, that is, in the last 600 million years. While relying on the conserved cellular processes brought forth from the earlier waves of innovation, anatomy also depends on the complex processes of embryonic development that evoke differentiated cells of several hundred kinds in a body of trillions of cells. So diverse and distinctive is anatomy that it has reliably served, beginning with Linnaeus, to classify living and fossil species, from which a pattern of evolutionary descent was later deduced. In general, the results of comparing DNA sequences of different animals have agreed with the anatomical phylogenies, although some significant discrepancies exist.Generating the special anatomy of each animal species is embryonic development from a single-celled egg. In its early stages of development, an …"
518,Five. Exploratory Behavior,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"WWe have seen that existing somatic adaptations can be a ready and available source for new variation when genetic change stabilizes adap-tive processes at different points along their ranges. This application of the Baldwin effect has not been widely endorsed as a panacea for explaining novelty in evolution, because the kind of variation that seems most interesting in evolution is not that which causes small quantitative perturbations of existing systems. Certainly, in anatomical novelty it is hard to imagine how an organism could store within itself the capacity for forming novel structures in the future, such as the first wing or the first eye.What kind of novelty might be stored in an organism, to be stabilized by mutation, for generating new anatomical structures, or for that matter new physiologies or new behaviors?

A Clock on the Heath,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"IIn 1802 the Reverend William Paley expressed his faith that life, full as it is of intricate design, must be the work of a Supreme and Intel-ligent Creator. In his now-famous metaphor, the minister wanders on the heath and stumbles across a brass watch. Plunged into thought, he asks how the watch came into being and reflects that his explanations are entirely different from those brought to mind when his boot hit a stone. The stone might have “lain there for-ever,” demanding no explanation. But the watch, with its carefully constructed wheels, teeth, springs, pointers, and oval glass face, each part perfectly suitable for the function of telling time, certainly must have been created by a designer of great skill. Even if the watch were broken or if we did not understand the workings of every part, our confidence in the existence of a designer would not be shaken. No one, Paley asserts, could believe that a purely blind and …"
520,Three. Physiological Adaptability and Evolution,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"EEvolution, as we have seen, is framed by two features: conservation on a cellular level and diversity on an anatomical and physiological level. How does diversification occur despite so much conservation? In this chapter we examine a few examples that reveal how conservation actually enables variation. The connection between the two is at the level of mechanisms; those that are exploited for evolution are the very ones that the organism uses day to day to vary its phenotype to meet new physiological demands. Such mechanisms can be easily modified in evolution to yield new phenotypes. The potential relationship between physiological variation and evolutionary variation had been considered by some evolutionary biologists in the premolecular era, without wide acceptance. It is on the molecular level that the link between the two is seen most distinctly and where the evidence for facilitated variation is most …"
521,Seven. Facilitated Variation,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"WWe summarize here in explicit terms our theory of facilitated variation, distinguishing it from other theories and providing evidence for it. The theory rests on molecular knowledge of a host of conserved cellular and developmental processes, which underlie and connect both somatic adaptation and phenotypic variation. Many evolutionary biologists do not see a need to connect somatic adaptability to the generation of variation, and some see a need to keep them separate. For them, it is sufficient to say that random mutation is required and that phenotypic variation arises haphazardly from it as random damage; the organism’s current phenotype does not matter for the variation produced, and the output of variation is nearly random. But from the research advances of the past few decades, it is apparent that biologists have underestimated the range of somatic adaptations produced by conserved processes …"
522,Eight. Is Life Plausible?,2008,Marc W Kirschner and John C Gerhart,"WWe now take a perspective outside the theory of facilitated variation to measure its explanatory power. Having asserted that facilitated var-iation is consistent with neo-Darwinian theory, we ask, To what extent is evolutionary theory now a complete theory? To incorporate facili-tated variation fully into the neo-Darwinian theory, we have to understand why it should be selected and maintained in populations. Many evolutionary biologists believe that any process that provides a future benefit must have an immediate benefit in each generation, or it will be lost. Whether or not such a stringent view is required, we still must evaluate the conditions under which facilitated variation can be selected. We have hinted at arguments for the selection of facilitated variation in passing; here we bring them together and evaluate them.In asking where, after facilitated variation, our understanding of evolution is still incomplete, we …"

Examples are then given of previous efforts at finding such a mechanism. Lamarck’s idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics is discussed along with the evidence that eventually led to it being rejected. The authors mention directed mutations, but claim that stressful conditions increase mutation rates in all genes and that no hint of directed genetic change has been found. The development of the Modern Synthesis is discussed. It is claimed that by 1940 the fossil record had grown and many gaps were filled. Archaeopteryx is suggested as implying a smooth transition between reptile and birds. They appear unaware that evolutionists in this field have pointed out that it is not transitional, but clearly a perching bird. 2 Other dubious examples of feathered dinosaurs are presented as well. 3 This chapter is heavy on the evolutionary storytelling, and the shallow examples used are adequately addressed within existing creationist literature. The authors conclude the chapter by stating that ‘… genetic variation is not channeled toward adaptation to selective conditions. Whatever bias there is to alter the amount and kind of phenotypic variation must arise out of the construction of the organism itself’(p. 34)."

529,"By HSIN YI HENRY HO, RAJAT ROHATGI",2006,ANDRES M LEBENSOHN and MARC W KIRSCHNER,"In the accompanying chapter, we describe an in vitro system that uses Xenopus egg extracts to study actin assembly induced by phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate (PIP2) and Cdc42. Biochemical fractionation and candidate screening experiments conducted in the extract system have identified the Arp2/3 complex, the NWASPWIP (or NWASPCR16) complex, and the Cdc42binding protein Toca1 as important mediators of PIP2 and Cdc42actin signaling. Toward our ultimate goal of reconstituting an in vitro system that recapitulates the signaling properties observed in vivo, we then developed a purified actin assembly assay system consisting of the regulatory components that we discovered from extracts. In these assays, the stereotypical sigmoidal kinetics of actin polymerization are monitored by pyreneactin fluorescence in the presence of defined recombinant or purified proteins, enabling the detailed study of mechanism and protein function. In this chapter, we describe the preparation of the components used in these purified actin assembly reactions, as well as the assay conditions under which we monitor actin polymerization kinetics in vitro."

Current molecular phylogenies place them as the sister group of the echinoderms (Adoutte et al., 2000; Cameron et al., 2000; Turbeville et al., 1994; Wada and Satoh, 1994). Despite the close relationship of these two groups, their respective adult body plans are highly divergent, and even gross axial comparisons between the groups are problematic. The bilateral symmetry, gill slits, stomochord, post-anal tail, and hollow dorsal nerve cord of hemichordates provide strong morphological affinities …"
536,Dynamic instability of microtubules,2004,Marc Kirschner and Tim Mitchison,"The cytoskeleton as a concept was in a sense created by the development of antibodies to tropomyosin (3274), tubulin (3275; 3276), and actin (3277) in the early 1970s. Immunofluorescence staining using these antibodies revealed a striking pattern of filaments that spanned long distances within the cell and were organized into networks that extended throughout the cytoplasm. The organization of filaments was highly variable from cell to cell, but was closely associated with the individual cell morphologies. These properties made the filaments good candidates for organizing cell shape and behavior. Before that time, the possibility of global organizing structures common to all types of cells had not been generally appreciated. Cell structure had been in the hands of cytologists, who had had no way of visualizing individual types of filaments, and electron microscopists, who had been unable to appreciate the global …"

Several reports have shown physical and functional associations between various Wnt, LRP, and Frizzled molecules; however, the underlying mechanisms for selectivity remain poorly understood. We present data on a novel set of Wnt-Fz fusion constructs that are useful for elucidating mechanisms of Wnt signal transduction specificity in both Xenopus embryos and 293T cells. In 293T cells, coexpression of several Wnt-Fz fusion proteins with LRP6, but not LRP5, significantly activated a Wnt-responsive promoter, Optimized TOPFlash. Interestingly, Wnt proteins from both the Wnt1 and Wnt5A classes, when fused to the same Frizzled, can …"

The Nck Src homology (SH) 2/3 adaptor binds via its SH3 domains to a proline-rich region on WASP and N-WASP and has been implicated in recruitment of these proteins to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. We show here that Nck SH3 domains dramatically stimulate the rate of nucleation of actin filaments by purified N-WASP in the presence of Arp2/3 in vitro. All three Nck SH3 domains are required for maximal activation. Nck-stimulated actin nucleation by N-WASPcntdotArp2/3 complexes is further stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, but not by GTP-Cdc42, suggesting that Nck and Cdc42 activate N-WASP by redundant …"

569,SC THE ROYAL SOCIETY,1999,Guowei Fang and Hongtao Yu and Marc W Kirschner,"Proteolysis controls key transitions at several points in the cell cycle. In mitosis, the activation of a large ubiquitin-protein ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), is required for anaphase initiation and for exit from mitosis. We show that APC is under complex control by a network of regulatory factors, CDC20, CDHI and MAD2. CDC20 and CDHI are activators of APC; they bind directly to APC and activate its cyclin ubiquitination activity. CDC20 activates APC at the onset of anaphase in a destruction box (DB)-dependent manner, while CDHI activates APC from late anaphase through Gl with apparently a much relaxed specificity for the DB. Therefore, CDC20 and CDHI control both the temporal order of activation and the substrate specificity of APC, and hence regulate different events during mitosis and Gl. Counteracting the effect of CDC20, the checkpoint protein MAD2 acts as an inhibitor of APC. When the spindle-assembly checkpoint is activated, MAD2 forms a ternary complex with CDC20 and APC to prevent activation of APC, and thereby arrests cells at prometaphase. Thus, a combination of positive and negative regulators establishes a regulatory circuit of APC, ensuring an ordered progression of events through cell division."

Second, the level of polymerization of the network can, in principle, be readily controlled by regulation of the activity of the Arp2/3 complex or the capping protein, or both. Finally, such an array-treadmilling mechanism could play a role in the persistence of lamellipodial protrusion and in the ability to adapt to changes in direction. A challenge for future research will be to unravel the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the interplay between structural organization and force generation and the pathways by which signalling molecules determine the mode of organization and function of protrusion."

626,Conformational changes in aspartate transcarbamylase,1971,Marc Wallace Kirschner,"Conformational changes in proteins are thought to be important in the mechanism of enzyme catalysis and regulation. Since hydrodynamic methods have particular advantages for distinguishing between local and gross changes in structure, we have reinvestigated a technique first described by Richards and Schachman (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79, 5324, 1957) for detecting conformational changes by measuring directly small differences in sedimentation coefficient, s, with the ultracentrifuge employing the Rayleigh interferometer. Though the method was potentially of great precision it suffered from systematic errors. These inaccuracies have been found now to be due to deficiencies in ultracentrifuge celis, misalignment of the Rayleigh mask, and an optical anomaly produced by high concentration gradients. Suitable remedies have been devised and the method tested with known systems. The precision and accuracy of the method was found to be 5% down to differences in s of 0.2%. In a number of proteins tested specific ligands produced significant changes in s thereby indicating that these proteins had undergone conformational changes.Previous studies had shown that succinate and carbamyl phosphate produce a large decrease in s for ATCase and a smaller increase in s for the catalytic subunit. Using the difference sedimentation technique this change of 1.1% for the catalytic subunit could be titrated as a function of succinate yielding a half titration value of 2 x 10'M."
627,On the Relationship of Protein and mRNA Dynamics in Vertebrate Embryonic Development,1969,Esther Pearl and Wilhelm Haas and RM Freeman Jr and John C Gerhart and Allon M Klein and Marko Horb and Steven P Gygi and Marc W Kirschner,"A biochemical explanation of development from the fertilized egg to the adult requires an understanding of the proteins and RNAs expressed over time during embryogenesis. We present a comprehensive characterization of protein and mRNA dynamics across early development in Xenopus. Surprisingly, we find that most protein levels change little and duplicated genes are expressed similarly. While the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is poor, a mass action kinetics model parameterized using protein synthesis and degradation rates regresses protein dynamics to RNA dynamics, corrected for initial protein concentration. This study provides detailed data for absolute levels of approximately 10,000 proteins and approximately 28,000 transcripts via a convenient web portal, a rich resource for developmental biologists. It underscores the lasting impact of maternal dowry, finds surprisingly few cases where degradation alone drives a change in protein level, and highlights the importance of transcription in shaping the dynamics of the embryonic proteome."
